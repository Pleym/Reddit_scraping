CR has lost their way,olkju7,2021-07-16 16:37:22,9,12,"I have been a subscriber to Consumer Reports for two decades.  I've recently decided after several years of growing concern over their processes, to not renew.

Let me explain.  Consumer Reports is a capable organization for some specific testing.  If I were to purchase a bread maker or washing machine, I'd be interested in their opinion.  If I were purchasing a car, it would be an interesting data point, but they seem most concerned with how many cup holders are accessible these days.  That said, I think their testing on driving aids (automatic collision avoidance, lane keeping, etc.) has value.

However, I have come to the conclusion they have major problems with sharing their data and  processes with their subscribers and often test small subsets or odd product numbers.  For example, air conditioners are often old models, and sunscreen tests a small percentage of what's available on the market including many major brands.  Continuing on the sunscreen example, CR doesn't explain their sample size (was it one sample or dozens?) or their rating scale.  If a sunscreen did not meet the SPF listed, was it only off by 1% or off by 90% from what was promised on the label?  This is important data and matters.

CR's continue refusal to surface the specific details and sample sizes of their testing results call to question the integrity of their findings.  Since I can no longer rely on their data, I can no longer subscribe to their publication/service.

If you want car tires, check out tire rack.  If you want cars, there are dozens of automotive-focused publications.  If you want an opinion other than your neighbor on a dish washer or BBQ grill, maybe take a look at CR.  If you are looking to really understand their criteria and the sample size and the specific test results, don't expect to find them.  CR has devolved to just another web site or magazine shilling opinion more than fact.

Many may disagree with the value, but there is no disagreement that CR does not publish their specific test details.  For that reason, I'm out."

EXCLUSIVE: Red state sues insurer for using customer data to build ‚Äòworld‚Äôs largest driving behavior database' | Fox News,1i0u8iu,2025-01-14 01:14:25,1,10,"This program called 'Drivewise' by Allstate is offered under other names by other major insurance companies. Their advertising aims at having you download their software with the possibility that you'll get a discount for safe driving, but the reality is that they're looking for an excuse to label you as a risky driver and increase your rates. For instance, if you drive in traffic daily to and from work the frequency that you have to brake and accelerate could label you as 'aggtessive' even though you're just driving in traffic."

So, I ordered this bouquet from Winni, expecting it to meet at least 70% of my expectations since I did pay somewhere around 800 for 8 roses. But when I saw what was delivered, I was shocked and furious. On top of that, when I raised a complaint, they were so blind to not see the clear difference ‚Äî for them, it was just a packaging issue, which they listed on their site. As a goodwill gesture, they offered me a refund of 50 INR. For them, they had delivered the same product.

Review of Dollar Car Rental & PlatePass: Unethical Billing Practices,1gbaygn,2024-10-24 19:22:04,1,7,"I recently rented a car from Dollar Car Rental at Buffalo Niagara International Airport and was hit with an undisclosed $139.95 fee from PlatePass after the rental period ended. Unfortunately, this experience has left me deeply disappointed with both companies, and I want to warn others about their unethical practices.

When my wife and I picked up the car, the EZ-Pass transponder was already open and active, and we were given no information at the rental desk about optional toll services like PlatePass. As tourists from a city without toll roads, we reasonably assumed the transponder was part of the service. At no point were we informed that using the transponder would automatically enroll us in a $139.95 PlatePass All-Inclusive package.

After returning home, Dollar and PlatePass attempted to charge my credit card, but the transaction was flagged as potential fraud. When I contacted them, they acknowledged that the fees were not clearly explained at pickup and offered only a partial fee reduction‚Äîstill expecting me to pay administrative charges I never knowingly opted into.

The transponder was pre-activated when we got in the vehicle. We never had a chance to opt in or out. Even if the terms were buried in a lengthy rental contract, it is unreasonable to expect customers to comb through fine print for such critical information. It is clear that Dollar and PlatePass use this hidden-fee tactic to generate revenue at the expense of unsuspecting customers.

If you are planning to rent from Dollar or any company partnered with PlatePass, be extremely careful‚Äîcheck the transponder before driving off and ask detailed questions about their toll policy.

I hope Dollar and PlatePass address this deceptive practice. But as it stands, I will not be using their services again and strongly recommend renters consider other options to avoid similar issues. To be clear, Dollar/Thrifty/Hertz are all owned by the same company.

In 2011, a class action lawsuit was filed against Hertz, Dollar, Thrifty, and their partner PlatePass over allegations of undisclosed and misleading toll-related fees. Customers reported being charged excessive administrative fees without proper disclosure, and some were enrolled in toll programs without their knowledge or consent.  
  
The legal proceedings culminated in settlements between 2014 and 2019. Hertz agreed to an $11 million settlement to address complaints that it had charged customers without sufficient notice about the PlatePass fees. Dollar and Thrifty faced similar legal challenges.  
  
These cases highlight a pattern of complaints about the lack of transparency in toll-related programs offered by the Hertz Corporation. Be warned. Better yet, choose another rental company."
Don‚Äôt buy.Away from these brands ,1g48vch,2024-10-15 14:21:22,0,8,"When purchasing VanMoof bikes or Polaroid cameras, please be aware that these products may cause fires. VanMoof bikes have caused injuries to consumers due to fire incidents, which also led to the company‚Äôs bankruptcy. 

The VanMoof management responsible for product development is now working in Polaroid‚Äôs product development management. There have also been instances of negative consumer reviews being removed. Polaroid instant camera quality has been terrible for many years.

If you‚Äôre considering buying a camera or bike, you might want to look at alternatives like FUJIFILM, Gazelle, or Scott, among others.

Chase Bank Hates and Harasses Rape Victims,1gzt4vg,2024-11-25 20:36:02,2,8,"So, I get drugged, raped, and robbed for almost 8k. Chase Bank is not only forcing me to pay my assailant, but they are harassing me in the process.

Initially, my claim was denied because Chase tracks your location by your cell phone, and they ‚Äúcaught‚Äù me being there that night. After rechecking, they saw my initial statement did say I was there. They also would not accept the police report.

After speaking with customer service again, they said the fraud agent was wrong and opened another claim. That claim was denied because it was submitted to the wrong department and it had to go to the dispute department. For it to go to the dispute department, I had to go into a branch so the manager could fax the items. I did this.

The dispute department said they never received the fax. The branch manager says he has a log of the fax going. The dispute department says even if the branch manager of a Chase Bank has proof he faxed the paperwork, it is now past the deadline of time to dispute it‚Ä¶.

6 months ago I walked into a bar. In that bar, I was taken to a back room where I was slipped drugs. While I was unconscious, I may have had objects put in me. I can only guess this occurred due to the intense pain I felt in specific areas the next morning. I went to the hospital that morning where I received almost a full check up but I did not report those specific pains due to the embarrassment‚Ä¶ that was dumb! I made a police report. They stole almost 8k off my credit card. 

Chase bank is aware of all the details, but is still forcing me to pay my rapist (possibly rapists?). They will not allow me to give them the police report as evidence. They did however allow 11 different charges hit my account that night, no signed reciepts, or any other indication that I consented to these charges. Yay.. lawyer time.

I am a married 40 y/o man raising two young boys. I want to remove this night from my memory, yet my bank of 20 years will not allow this."
I can‚Äôt lie! This is why I left my well paying job at a consumer company.,1gae5wy,2024-10-23 16:02:31,7,7,"This is insane‚Ä¶

Consumer goods manufacturers are so creative when it comes to deceiving people. This is a perfect example of how you can find a loophole, a workaround around to NOT MENTION sugar as THE MAIN ingredient! Look at the following list. They created an artificial ingredient called ‚Äúorganic coffee blend‚Äù. as you know, all ingredients go in sequence of their portion as percentage of the total package. Since they combined multiple ingredients into one called the blend they artificially pushed sugar down the list. Good job guys! I just drank a ton of sugar.

PS: you also should add ‚Äúorganic‚Äù to every single incident that you have so that sugar goes all the way down


Did anyone recognize the brand?


PS2: I used to work as a consultant helping multi billion consumer goods corporation engineer these tactics on a global scale. These companies spend hundreds of millions to come up with a clever packaging, design, branding, marketing, all sort of tricks, just to make sure you stay addicted to sugar and similar stuff.

Tesla service ruined my tesla,1cm242u,2024-05-07 03:18:49,0,8,"I have another Tesla incident. Last year on March, my Tesla got flat rear tires on the freeway. We called Tesla service, and they changed both of the tires. Then again in November, one of the tires got flat again, and we had tesla changed it. The remaining one we claimed Michelin warranty and got it exchanged with the same tire.

Then recently while having maintenance at Tesla, they found out that my car axle shaft was worn out, and one of the nails almost fall out. They claimed that it was due to the imbalanced car tires. One of the rear tire is 295 size while the other is 265 size. So they said it was American Tires (who changed my Michelin tire) fault. However, we figured out that since the very first time Tesla changed my tires in March, they already put the wrong tires (265size tires). Since the tires were not at their correct size, they got worn out quickly, and Tesla changed it to the correct one 295size However, the remaining tire got exchanged under warranty, and stayed 265Psize. That‚Äôs why it totally ruined my car.¬†¬†Now our car cant be driven and is waiting for repair.

What should I do? Can I sue them for negligence ?"

AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS!,14rrh9q,2023-07-05 23:44:05,2,6,"  

In October 2022, we met with 2 representatives from **Provincial Smart Home Services** (PSHS), to evaluate our home for energy efficiency and cost savings.

The sales pitch was slick ‚Äì tons of savings, rebates from Enercare ($300) and the Ontario government ($1,450), a buyout of our rental agreements with Enercare Home Services (we were renting our A/C, furnace, and water heater from Enercare at that time), and a service agreement for the heating/cooling equipment.

This was all put in writing and included in our contract. Some initial work and minor energy saving changes were done quickly (home thermostat, tankless water heater, attic insulation, door security camera). They didn‚Äôt waste any time selling the cost of the entire program to Simply Group Finance and we were required to sign a loan agreement with them.

**DO NOT BELIEVE THIS COMPANY‚ÄôS PROMISES! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!**

More than 9 MONTHS LATER, neither the buyout nor the rebates have materialized. We have had many phone calls and emails with the PSHS (‚ÄúCustomer Relations‚Äù) to attempt to resolve this matter. Enercare is now coming after us for the buyout payment PSHS was obligated to pay (more than $19K). We are now making payment on the loan with Simply Group Financial which paid PSHS for their services AND we face paying twice for the same services and still not getting the service. We have filed an official complaint with the Better Business Bureau ‚Äì which prompted yet another ‚Äúpromise‚Äù of payment, but no payment. Now we are moving to a formal complaint with Ontario Consumer Affairs, and legal action. 

The BBB has recorded 52 complaints about this company in the last 12 months alone. In our opinion, PSHS seems to be well practiced in making false promises as a stonewalling and delay tactic. According to the BBB‚Äôs website, PSHS is offering compensation or incentives to individuals who post reviews. Also, the average rating of all customer reviews is 1/5. Had we seen this last fall, we NEVER would have signed on with them.

As we now face what appears to be PSHS‚Äôs complete disregard and contempt for the MONTHS of follow-ups, empty verbal and written promises to pay out (from at least three ‚Äúcustomer relations‚Äù persons at PSHS, all documented), and their refusal to respect their commitments, it is our reasonable opinion that PSHS\`s business model is to bamboozle customers with promises of savings and efficiencies, do some inexpensive installation quickly to assuage any ‚Äúbuyer\`s remorse‚Äù the customer might experience during the cooling down period mandated by the *Consumer Protection Act*, add their legally contracted obligations to the ‚Äúanother sucker‚Äù pile, and then blatantly ignore customers in the hopes that they will go away. This is the most pathetic excuse for ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù we have ever experienced, and given the large sums involved, certainly the most stressful.

At the time of writing this review, PSHS\`s website states that the owners are Mohammed Osman and Khalid Elmi.

For the record: we are NOT disgruntled employees seeking retribution, and except for our stated opinions above, everything contained in this complaint is 100% factual and well documented."
Joining Consumer Reports,1j3hllj,2025-03-04 18:23:32,6,5,"I‚Äôm seriously thinking about signing up for a consumer reports digital subscription.

Whirlpool‚Äôs careless service,1hsja12,2025-01-03 10:09:33,0,4,"
I am utterly frustrated and feel compelled to share my experience with Whirlpool‚Äôs disgraceful customer service.

I have a few years old Whirlpool refrigerator that stopped working over a month ago. I contacted Whirlpool‚Äôs customer care, and they scheduled an engineer visit to diagnose the issue. A technician named Talha, roughly 20 years old, visited and confidently stated that replacing some parts costing ‚Çπ3500 would fix the issue. Despite knowing the refrigerator wouldn‚Äôt sell for even ‚Çπ1500, we trusted his repeated assurances and proceeded with the repairs.

To our shock, the fridge stopped working the very next day.

We contacted customer care again, and another engineer, Ali, visited. He contradicted Talha, stating that the earlier part replacement was unnecessary and that the actual issue was with the heater, which would cost an additional ‚Çπ3200. We refused, as spending ‚Çπ6400-7000 on a fridge worth less than ‚Çπ2000 is unreasonable.

Another complaint led to yet another visit‚Äîthis time by a third engineer, Imran, who replaced the heater at no extra cost. The fridge worked for four days and stopped again.

On December 28, I received a call from Whirlpool‚Äôs customer care for feedback. They scheduled a fourth visit, but it has been five days, and no one has shown up.

This level of mismanagement, incompetence, and unprofessionalism is unacceptable. Your engineers are clearly untrained, contradictory in their diagnoses, and unable to resolve the issue. My food items worth more than ‚Çπ10,000 have been damaged because of your faulty product and subpar service.

Whirlpool, do you even have the ability to fix your own product? How do you intend to compensate me for the financial and mental distress caused by this fiasco?

It‚Äôs high time you address this mess and take accountability for your failure.

Let me know if you‚Äôd like further adjustments or need help sending this effectively."

Scrub Free kills roaches!,1e5lnxi,2024-07-17 15:53:32,1,5,I have found that directly spraying scrub free bathroom cleaner directly on a roach kills them in less than 10 seconds. This is dramatically faster than directly spraying them with pesticides.  I use this approach on kitchen counters. It does not work as a pesticide after it dries as it does not get on the roaches. Useful for when killing visible roaches when not in a area where swatting is possible. 
Can you ever trust Hotels.com again? If you hear that it intentionally stole rewards from its customers,18aac39,2023-12-04 02:41:04,3,4," **What happened:** I have been booking hotels for personal trip using hotels.com, since 2013. He accumulated 25 free nights worth. The policy in place at the time, i.e., before May 2023, was that the counter on expiration of these night was reset every time new stays were booked. If 12 months pass, the nights would expired. The tally captured above was the value in November 2019, when the last stay in 2019 was booked. With COVID19, hotel.com communicated via email that it was suspending the expiration policy: customers maintain their status and reward nights. I also booked in October 2021 and June 2023. Per the announcement and policy, the reward nights valid on November 2019 ad at most only 3 to 4 \[November 2019 till February 2020 when expiration was suspended for COVID\] + 1 months \[May 2023 (when expiration restored) till June 2023 (when new boking took place. During the suspended month, the months did not count. That was admitted by Luis, self-stated highest level supervisor in charge of handling these policy issues. 

The announcement of the suspension of the expiration policy did not provide any process to sign-up, or ensure that nights are not expiring. Requests to see copy of the 2020 announcement have been ignored by most support agent.

Around May 2023, hotels.com announced combination of expedia.com and hotels.com rewards under what they call One Key. For sure the program is pathetic versus what Hotels.com offered (i.e. one free night every 10 nights (cheapest rate in the 10 nights) vs. 2% of spent with the new reward program), but that is a different issue.

At the end of August 2023, I checked the new one key status and see only \~ USD 200, in it. From early September till December 2023, communications (email and calls to agents and supervisors), have resulted into hotels.com claiming 1) that the 2019 and before free night had expired 2) that they were not available for review any more 3) that they can‚Äôt be restored, 4) (end of November) that they were 25 free nights and refused to provide past statements (stays and or rewards, copy of COVID suspension announcement and copy of any expiration announcement). Offered to refund USD 500 were made.

Luis finally explained, or should we say admitted, and it is all on tape, that:

¬∑ The 25 free nights worth were not expired. However, I should have contacted hotels.com to have them restored (not mentioned anywhere and why would that be considering the COVID announcement). When asked to provide copy of the email announcement, Luis rejected.

¬∑ When asked how the customer know that he stated expiration notices supposedly sent (i.e. \~ Nov 21 and Oct 2022). No such notice were ever received. 

¬∑ Then Luis explained that hotels.com had a policy that request to restore had to be done before May 8, 2023 and the customer couldn‚Äôt know it. It was an internal policy that had not been communicated to customers!

¬∑ The Luis repeated the mantra of all the agents: therefore the rewards are expired and they can‚Äôt be restored. But he offered a courtesy addition to One Key, and stated noting more can be done.

Isn‚Äôt that stealing? Can you still trust hotels.com or expedia (parent company)? Avoidhotels.com like the pest!

Why I Will Never Buy Another EGO Product Ever Again,10h6uxe,2023-01-20 20:11:00,2,4,"**TL;DR: The Lawn Mowers are great; the String Trimmer I bought was a lemon; and Customer Service is useless and does not honor their 5-year warranty.**

&#x200B;

As a returning customer who owns an **EGO POWER+ Select Cut 56-Volt Brushless Lithium Ion Self-Propelled 21-in Cordless Electric Lawn Mower**, I purchased an **EGO** **ST1510T** string trimmer on 3/4/21. Straight out of the box I had issues with the trimmer line getting pulled in while using the unit. I called customer support and they discouraged me from returning the unit and stupidly, I listened.

Over the next few months, I went back and forth with customer service about a dozen times and followed through with all of the troubleshooting steps, none of which resolved the issue.

Finally, EGO suggested I replace (at my own expense) the compression spring in the unit. I ordered the spring (code: EGO-3660582001) from Parts Warehouse (as per EGO support) but this did not fix the issue. I once again called EGO customer service on 9/16/22 and was told I would need to buy a new head unit, which was over $50.

I escalated my case to a manager who granted a one time exception and had the head unit (EGO Power+ 00354217) mailed to me at their expense. This also did not resolve the issue. Ego finally relented and referred me to my local service center.

I tried twice to bring it to this service center and, despite being open from 7:30 - 4:00 pm on weekdays (real convenient /s), it has been closed both times I stopped by (3:30 on Friday 11/18/22 and 11/25/22). The other day I finally was able to drop it off while they were open. When I dropped it off they said they had everything they needed. Today I received a call saying I'd need to drop the battery and charger off with them, and of course they are only open limited hours which happen to be when I work (8:00 am - 4:00 pm M-F).

The warranty on this unit is 5 years and EGO is not standing behind their product. They have made it difficult every step of the way to get this thing working again. I have tried every troubleshooting method on about a dozen customer care calls, replaced two parts (one with my own money), and spent probably about a dozen+ hours with customer service on this.

After all of this, the line still gets sucked back in to the unit while I am trimming.

**Would not recommend - stay away from EGO products.**

Edit: I've also tried submitting a complaint with the BBB but EGO (owned by Chevron) does not respond to those complaints."
Dealership charging a 20k mark up on a Civic. How and why does the government allow this,yrvllg,2022-11-10 23:50:33,3,6,
"NEW GLOBAL MOVEMENT ""Stop Buying Stuff"" - opinions?",vhci6z,2022-06-21 12:45:02,2,4,"In retaliation to product and services prices increase, but a decline in quality over past year... a new movement has started.

""Stop Buying Stuff"".

Although it is a green solution, and encourages thrift, and saving money ¬£$‚Ç¨¬•¬¢... it's also a statement to businesses that we refuse to take their bad behaviour.

Why should we pay more (In the UK, Scotland to be exact), but suffer poor or unusuable products and services!!?

Customer loses, daily life becomes more stressful and inconvenient, and YET, we are all still paying more than usual.

Therefore it has been suggested that we just ""STOP BUYING STUFF"".

...you can't trust any business these days, even video game developers.   I laugh when I see ""pre-order"" anywhere these days, because the trust between CORPOS and citizens has EVAPORATED! , it's gone completely! ...sure we were aware of profiteering tactics before, but these days it's gone beyond.

What do you think of the movement, is it a danger to businesses, to the global economy... is it a great green idea, to force us into a greener life?

I'm 100% backing it, I am sick of business taking advantage at the expense of our environment, mental well-being and the health of consumers!!  (Scotland's Government is obviously to blame, because they are allowing these products and services to be sold, and they don't care about the citizens - it's our government...yet they behave like a power unto their own, who only care or support commerce)

Stop buying stuff? or return to the 90s, and we take to the streets like in the regular 90s West Coast US riots against CORPOS."

Do Not Accept Invoices from Online QuickBooks,1eqmbpu,2024-08-12 19:06:40,0,4,"Please know that Intuit Online Quickbooks allows contractors to change estimates without notification to the person paying the estimate.  I provided proof of this to the President.  Intuit could care less about protecting consumers who are not their customers.  I advise all consumers not to accept any estimates from a contractor using online Quickbooks.  As you can see below Intuit could care less about protecting consumers.

Intuit response:

After conducting a thorough investigation and carefully reviewing your interactions with our support experts, we are unable to provide further assistance as you are not an Intuit customer. As previously communicated during our call and via email, the QuickBooks Online (QBO) software is functioning as intended. An estimate is a preliminary calculation of costs, services, and materials, and is subject to change or modification. This process is explained in detail in this article.

If your contractor made changes to your estimate without informing you, we recommend addressing this matter directly with them. 

*******It is important to note that QBO is a Do-It-Yourself product and does not include a feature that notifies the end-users customer of changes made to an estimate.********* (emphasis added)

Avoid Hi-Rise Fitness for Personal Training,1bj32a5,2024-03-20 02:39:46,2,3,"Update: Now DashPT. The owner has either created a new company or renamed Hi-Rise Fitness to Dash PT ([https://dash-pt.com](https://dash-pt.com)) and Dash Training on instagram ([https://www.instagram.com/dashtraining](https://www.instagram.com/dashtraining)). It's interesting to see that the comments are disabled for every single post on Dash PT's instagram account.

PSA about a personal training company called [Hi-Rise Fitness](https://www.hi-risefitness.com) headquartered in Minnesota. They boast service to 30,000 residents in several states. My experience left a bit to be desired, and I‚Äôve noticed I‚Äôm not the only one with gripes.

The main issue I ran into was with their billing. Out of the blue, I got charged double my usual rate one month, throwing my budget off balance. Trying to get it sorted was a real headache, and it looks like this sort of thing isn‚Äôt rare with them.

Another snag was the contract terms. I signed up thinking it was a straightforward 5-month deal. Later, they tried to collect an extra payment because they said the contract says billing is every 4 weeks, not monthly. This detail was not made clear from the get-go.

Reaching out to them about these problems was frustrating. Responses were slow or non-existent, and when I did get through, the vibe was more about shifting blame than fixing issues. Digging deeper online, it‚Äôs clear others have faced similar and more extreme challenges, not just with billing but with how the company handles concerns.

On the flip side, I gotta say my personal trainer was fantastic‚Äîtruly a pro and super supportive. It‚Äôs unfortunate he left the company after having issues receiving pay.

So, if you‚Äôre considering Hi-Rise Fitness, my advice is to avoid them. Make sure to do your homework and explore other options. Finding the right fit is key to supporting your fitness goals without unnecessary drama.

Take care and choose wisely!"
"Global Product Quality Decline - BUT, Prices Increase?",vhbv2c,2022-06-21 12:11:29,1,3,"Have you noticed any products that have all of a sudden decreased in quality making them unpleasant or unable to be used any longer?

I'll start - pocket tissues !! (in the UK).

*Kleenex Balsam Tissues (Made In Italy), were out of stock everywhere for a long time, then they started to appear again, but the quality is AWFUL!

One blow, and it falls apart leaving white pieces of tissue all over your clothing.  I've used them for years, and now all of a sudden they are unusable (Made in Italy)... and the crazy thing is, the price jumped up significantly!

*Boots Balsam Tissues (Made In Slovenia) ... not cheap, fairly expensive too be honest since there's only six instead of eight to a packet... they now smell like sick!!

*CO-OP/Sainsbury Pocket Tissues - both have a burnt smell to them, as though they were made in a factory cooking rotisserie chickens !!!?

Not my imagination, tried on other friends, same results.

Pocket tissue supply to UK has been compromised, and the price still increased, and all qualities reduced.

Any products you have noticed that have been downgraded? - please list here."

LG sucks,1igb6g5,2025-02-02 23:38:02,3,3,Anyone in Ohio have an LG refrigerator die within 5 years? Yeah it‚Äôs no coincidence and the company knows about it!

They won‚Äôt stand behind them and neither will the the store you bought the unit from. @Lowes is the worst customer service on this issue and they act clueless to it when confronted. LG only response is to put the same exact parts back in your refrigerator. Not a compressor that has been reconfigured to make up for the faulty parts but the same exact part! They will offer you grocery $$ but without a refrigerator where would you put the groceries? They act surprised when you bring up the class action suits against them that they already paid out on!! Do Not Buy LG anything!! The executive ‚ÄúPresidents‚Äù level of escalation does nothing and they will never call you back!! 
Tyson Foods Mislabels Their Weight?,1i95s0n,2025-01-24 20:56:29,1,3,"A couple weeks ago, I bought this Tyson Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast advertised as 2.02 lbs. net weight. I refrigerated it and the next day weighed in on my digital scale at 1 lbs. 12.6 oz. It wasn't till I added the accompanying ""absorbent pad"" that it came to 2.02 lbs. I'm pretty sure the FDA prohibits that. That amounts to about a 12% shortchange.

From ChatGPT:

""The requirement that the net weight of meat and poultry products must exclude the weight of packaging materials, including absorbent pads, is based on regulations set by the **United States Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA FSIS)**.

Specifically:

* The FSIS enforces **9 CFR ¬ß 317.19 and ¬ß 381.121**, which mandate that the labeled net weight of meat and poultry products reflect only the **consumable** portion, excluding packaging materials like absorbent pads.
* The FSIS has also issued guidance to industry participants emphasizing that **net weight must represent only the edible product** and must not include any components of the packaging.""

This doesn't seem legal/ethical. Thoughts? Has anyone else experienced this? Am I wrong about this?

Alamo-my,1clvtht,2024-05-06 22:16:01,0,3,"I'd like to tell you the true story of my experience with Alamo car rental at MEM.
We (my wife and I) were in Memphis as the base for our trip to see the 2024 eclipse. We intended to drive into Arkansas on Monday, April 8th. We were given a Jeep at the airport.
We got up early to be sure to beat most of the traffic heading in the same direction.
We stopped at a McDonald's to grab a little breakfast. After we got our order we drove across the street to an empty parking to eat what we'd bought from McD's. As we were eating, we noticed we were about 50 feet from an ATM- which was fortuitous because we'd give almost all of our cash out as tips and to beggars the day before. We got $200 from the ATM and were a little surprised that it was all in 10-dollar bills (not relevant to the story, sorry). I put the cash in the little depression just forward of the shift lever. My wife put her phone on top of the cash.
After we finished, we took off for Arkansas. Unfortunately, within a block we got a warning indicator and an accompanying chime. The wife looked in the manual and found it was something that had to be taken care of immediately.
We called Alamo's roadside assistance and they asked if we could get the Jeep back to the airport. That worked for us so we brought it there.
When we got to the rental car return area, we scrambled to get out backpacks and suitcases out of the back of the Jeep and loaded them into our newly-assigned vehicle (Mitsubishi Out-something). The exchange went better than we expected. We headed out to the the booth and were ready to go when my wife asked if I had picked up our $200 ATM cash. I did a quick check - as did she - and neither of us had picked it up. We told the lady in the booth what had happened and she directed us back to the entrance to the drop-off area.
When we got there, the same person (I'll call him Gentleman #1) who had swapped our car was there. We told him what happened and he said, ""All I did was move it from here over to there."" I thought that an odd thing to say but we continued to find the Jeep. We searched the Jeep and the cash we had left about 10 minutes before was not there. Gentleman #1 repeated his assertion that "" All I did was move it from here over to there."" I asked him if there was someplace I could report this loss. He hemmed and hawed a bit but eventually said I could talk to the guy at the desk. I walked over to the desk (the one just outside the rental area doors) and told gentleman #2 the story of the missing $200. He hemmed and hawed a bit but eventually said we should go and take ANOTHER look in the Jeep to see if it was there. We started toward the area where our car(s) were when we heard Gentleman #1 yelling. He was saying that he had found our cash and that it must have fallen onto the floor. My wife later told me that, while I was getting the suitcases from the rear hatch, she was getting our backpacks from the back seat and that Gentleman #1 was in the front seat, he reach back between the seats and handed my wife her phone. That was the phone that had been sitting on top of the cash.
On hearing that news, Gentleman #2 grabbed my elbow and said I'd ""better give that man a tip."" He also offered that I should give him a tip as well.
Since we had already been delayed and eclipses don't happen all that often, I gave Gentleman #2 $10 and Gentleman #1 $20.
It took a while to spit out all the bile but we eventually made it to our destination.
Just to be clear, Gentleman #1 - in the front seat - took my wife's phone off the pile of 10's and handed it to here through the gap between the front seat, blocking her view of the front. He waited to see if it registered with her that the cash was there - but it didn't because we were scrambling to get going to the eclipse. When he saw it was ok, he pocketed the cash.
I've since contacted Alamo several times about what happened and get no response (except from their Support Desk). You can imagine what kind of impression I got about Alamo.
Forewarned is forearmed my fellow travelers."

Beware of Smytten's Shady Discount Practices,1jmsd96,2025-03-29 18:08:57,0,2,"I recently noticed something sketchy while shopping on Smytten, and I wanted to warn others.

I had items in my cart totaling ‚Çπ555. Then, I applied a 10% off coupon, expecting a decent discount. However, instead of saving money, I realized something odd:

The discount was only ‚Çπ53 instead of the expected ‚Çπ55.

But suddenly, a ‚Çπ50 shipping fee appeared, which wasn‚Äôt there before.

So now, instead of paying ‚Çπ555, I was paying ‚Çπ552.


Basically, the ""discount"" was meaningless‚Äîthey just added a hidden charge to cancel out the savings. This feels like a classic case of deceptive pricing, where they make you think you‚Äôre getting a deal, but in reality, you‚Äôre not saving anything.

Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like this kind of practice should be called out, as it‚Äôs misleading to customers who genuinely think they‚Äôre getting a discount."

He‚Äôs used to using the bathroom there, and it is public property, so everyone‚Äôs dog uses their bathroom in that spot. (Mentioning, I always bring a plastic bag with me to pick up after my dog uses the bathroom.) recently, there had been a neighbor watching me from across the street, at first I didn‚Äôt mind it, because people in this area like to sit infront of their house and enjoy the time outside. The other day, I had came back from an appointment and went to go walk my dog, and then that lady came up to me asking ‚Äúwhy does ur  dog poop here? This is my property, how would u like it if a dog pooped on your property?‚Äù And mind you, I am a child, and I picked up after myself. After our conversation, my mom noticed I looked upset when I was walking back home, so I told her what happened, she told me to leave it off and she will handle it as the adult she is. A few days later, I went to the PUBLIC area again for my dog to use the bathroom, this time she came outside with her dog, and followed me home for her dog could poop infront of my house, I ignored it and told my mom, and again today, she followed me home and started yelling at me and made her dog use the bathroom on my private property and did not pick up after herself. So that‚Äôs where the situation escalated, she is technically harassing me from following me home, and I am underaged, I told my mother and now we are filing reports, and we talked to our neighbor who‚Äôs lived here for a while, and they informed us that it is public property and she had no right to follow a minor home back to a private property so now she is in the wrong."

TSC is TRASH,1gdqkkj,2024-10-28 01:20:37,3,1,"On October 3rd I ordered a new MacBook from TSC because, although their prices aren‚Äôt very good, they let you pay in 12 equal instalments without a credit check which is a convenient payment option. 

Fast forward to today, October 27th, my computer still hasn‚Äôt shipped and I‚Äôve been lied to by every single person I‚Äôve spoken to when I ask why it‚Äôs taking so long. In the attached transcript from October 9th the CSR tells me shipping is slower on high value items and when I tell them that doesn‚Äôt make sense they switch gears and tell me it‚Äôs because my account is new - which is another lie because I‚Äôve ordered a computer from them before and it didn‚Äôt take nearly as long. 

On the 22nd I had another CSR tell me it was going to ship on the 23rd which was another lie since it‚Äôs now the 27th and it still hasn‚Äôt shipped.

I followed up again on the 25th asking to file a formal complaint and escalate it to the appropriate team and the person who responded with this: 

‚ÄúWe understand you are anxious to receive your order. Upon reviewing the order, we see the item you ordered is coming directly from our vendor, which is located in the U.S. For such items to be delivered, the shipping timeframe is longer.

Just to share for future reference that items start with 6 or 7 are directly shipped by the vendor. This information can be seen on our website:  https://www.tsc.ca/pages/customer-service/delivery-methods‚Äù.
It was never disclosed to me that there would be a shipping delay for any reason. When I put the order in it said it would ship October 4th. It still says this is the shipping date on my account. Imagine using info buried deep in an obscure FAQ somewhere to try to blame the customer! Like hey buddy, I can‚Äôt believe you didn‚Äôt read THE ENTIRE FAQ before ordering. What an idiot! Customer service at TSC seems to be the stuff of mythology. Lies, deception, passing the buck, etc. are how they do business.

I‚Äôve already made $500 worth of payments on a computer I don‚Äôt even have in my possession. This company should be avoided if you can help it.

Thomson TV 43 inch defective TV,1jfk8ri,2025-03-20 08:33:11,0,1,"I purchased a Thomson 43 inch tv on Flipkart Axis Bank credit card from Flipkart after checking their customer reviews.Within a month, a vertical line appeared on the screen.

I tried calling them for 3 days, the call didn't even ring, it got disconnected. Finally got the last 2 days, the line was ringing for more than 20 mins and no one answered. Even if they are trying to address the issue will they service the TV or replace it with a new one? I converted the charged amount to EMI and the 1st emi is due in a few days. So, I wanted to get a solution for this before the EMI due. Can I raise a chargeback request on this product and cancel the EMI. What are the chances of reversal of the debited amount? I contacted Axis bank regarding this, if I raise a request to cancel the EMI they will do it and once the merchant reverses the debited amount, it will be reflected in my credit card balance. Is this possible? Once the EMI is cancelled and if the merchant takes time or doesn't reverse the debited amount to the bank? What will happen to the principal amount, should I have to pay interest until the payment is reversed? I did a mistake by choosing the Thomson brand. Please help me"

Was essentially scammed by a large UK Telecoms company. (Company called ‚ÄúBT‚Äù),1j8f49z,2025-03-11 01:19:07,0,1,"British Telecoms (BT), one of the largest telecommunication providers in the UK, duped me into signing a new two-year contract with them, under the guise of replacing my outdated home internet equipment. I was led to believe this was a change of equipment for functionality reasons, and that should I agree, I would be paying a lesser amount each month as I was currently overpaying. 

I only realized what had truly happened the following month, when I called to switch to a new provider after seeing a good offer. BT said I would have to pay a significant amount to leave, and that I ""should have read the terms and conditions.""

I‚Äôve since discovered that this same company was fined last year for similar misleading practices (see article attached).

Re next steps, I‚Äôve requested a copy of the call transcripts and I plan to report them to the relevant authorities (UK Ofcom and the Ombudsman). 

But I also wonder whether stronger action can be taken to get meaningful change. This is a billion dollar company who evidently continue bad practices in-spite of fines.

Amazon gave out my address to a stranger!

T Mobile billing purposely confusing so they can cheat people when they leave,1j4zjnj,2025-03-06 16:34:08,0,1,"T Mobile has a ""billing cycle"" which is the previous 30 days from the date of the bill. On that bill will be any changes made during that 30 days, plus a charge for service for the NEXT 30 days. Not only is it difficult for consumers to read the bill, their own customer service is incapable of doing so. I confirmed this when I first started with them, when I didn't understand why I was paying almost two whole months on my FIRST bill. I confirmed it again when I closed my account on February 5. I had paid through January 29th in December and the person who helped me with the transfer pin for the last of our lines confirmed that I should only owe the 6-7 days since then. My access to my account and copies of my bills was immediately taken away and reaching someone without an active T Mobile number is a nightmare. So I was mindful of needing to confirm and pay my final balance, but had a great deal of difficulty doing so. On 2/19, I was charged the full amount of the bill for 1/30 - 2/28 or $142.49. My first call took my more than 30 minutes to reach a person, because I had to finagle the system without an active number. That person insisted that my pin didn't work and that I would have to go into a store with an ID. I have used the pin many times recently and knew it was correct. Eventually they pretended not to hear me so they could hang up. I spent another 10-15 minutes reaching a person again. Magically my pin worked this time! However, this person insisted that I been charged the bill through 1/29 because that was the ""billing cycle"" No matter what I said, no matter what I asked them to read from the bill, they would not budge. So I asked for the supervisor. This was even worse. They refused to send me a copy of the bill and continued to insist that since the billing cycle was 12/29 - 1/29, that those were the dates of service I paid for. I have tried to find other avenues of getting this corrected, meanwhile they have stolen this money from me."

SAFishing = Shady business,1isxk74,2025-02-19 05:01:58,0,1,"On January 24th, 2025 I ordered the National tree day/Pine ridge snapback. I chose the ""pre-order"" option, as it costed significantly less. The shipment date was set for February 7th. After the 7th, there were NO new updates on the Shop app. It continued to say ""Preparing for shipment"" up until February 15th. That's when I emailed customer service.

I asked what the status of my hat was, along with my order number.. as there were no updates. I received a response on February 17th. And this is what it stated:

""Hello Neil, my name is Linda I will be helping you out today.

Thank you for your order! We appreciate your support.

Unfortunately, the item Special Edition Performance Snapback | National Tree Day | Pine Ridge from your order #******* (I censored the order number for personal reasons) is currently out of stock due to high demand. Regrettably it won‚Äôt be available anytime soon.

If you‚Äôd like, we can help you find a replacement item from our website. Alternatively, if you prefer a refund for that item. Please let us know how you‚Äôd like to proceed.""

How infuriating. The problem here is that I purchased the hat because of an Ad they were running on Instagram. An advertisement they chose to run, even though they were knowingly out of stock. They had ample time since my order on Jan 24th to notify me of this. They did not. Instead they took my money and failed to communicate that they would not be carrying it anymore. For almost over a month they were aware of this. They are STILL running this advertisement on Instagram AND Facebook...and the item is STILL listed on their website for sale as of this very moment. (February 18th)

This is nothing short of THEFT & FRAUD. Either someone is not doing their jobs, they're scammers, or both. They are performing fraudulent business practices by advertising an item they allegedly do NOT have...and by continuing to have it listed on their website and allowing monetary transactions to occur. This is flat out theft. Period.

Throughout this debacle, I've found similar instances of this occuring throughout online, reddit, and the BBB website. Stay away from this company. This is inexcusable and not justifiable on their end.

I could understand a miscalculation, but again...why was i not notified?

Sure, great they offered a refund. Hopefully I get it. But again, why continue to advertise something and let people give you money while you knowingly do not have this item? Shady. "

The lady at the desk said I'd never make it to the gate in time which was total BS. The airport is small and I knew I'd make it. Anyways, she said I needed to call the 3rd party company I purchased the tickets from. I called, the person I spoke to said I didn't call in enough time to have the return ticket replaced. He told me I should have called 15 minutes ago. I said I've been on hold for 10 minutes and that I called in enough time. He proceeded to argue with me. He said if I wanted a new ticket for today it would be $3000. I told him I did not have that kind of money and could he find me a better deal. He told me, if I wanted to fly out on the 9th instead, it would be $2797. I asked him if I made it to Dublin, which was my stop over, in time for my connecting flight, can I still get that flight. He got very indignant and said it doesn't work that way. Needless to say, I haven't left England yet. Airlines and these discounted companies are such a rip off.

Plaud ai,1hp4wd6,2024-12-29 20:24:13,0,1,"
PLAUD AI, a company introducing a new-to-market AI product, has chosen USPS as its primary delivery partner. While USPS is a widely used service, this decision has proven detrimental to the company‚Äôs launch strategy due to significant delays in product delivery. Customers report waiting 2-3 weeks for their orders, leading to frustration and dissatisfaction.

For a cutting-edge technology company, fast and reliable delivery is critical to building trust and ensuring a positive user experience. PLAUD AI‚Äôs decision to rely on USPS, without considering its potential inefficiencies for time-sensitive shipments, undermines the urgency and excitement associated with a new product launch.

Key issues:
	‚Ä¢	Long Delivery Times: The 2-3 week delivery window creates a disconnect between PLAUD AI‚Äôs innovative brand and its logistical execution.
	‚Ä¢	Consumer Frustration: Delays in receiving products diminish consumer enthusiasm and could lead to negative reviews, impacting the brand‚Äôs reputation.
	‚Ä¢	Competitive Disadvantage: In an industry where speed and customer satisfaction are paramount, PLAUD AI risks losing customers to competitors offering faster and more reliable delivery options.

To succeed, PLAUD AI must reassess its logistics strategy, possibly exploring partnerships with premium carriers like FedEx or UPS, or implementing expedited shipping options to ensure faster delivery. The initial impression a company makes is crucial, and failing to meet delivery expectations can derail even the most innovative products."

Phlebotomy Training Specialists 1/10 stars. ,1etso0q,2024-08-16 16:04:22,0,1,"They're a class that advertises to give you everything you need to get certified to be a Phlebotomist on the national level, and they say 48 hours of training and use of our veinviewer technology to see inside the patient's arms, and ""Closely supervised"" instruction. 

I signed up. When I got there I realized it was a lot smaller than I thought, like ten people, and it was just taught in some depressing empty classroom. There WAS some needle equipment scattered around which was all expired. The teacher, some big Dominican guy, just had us read all day that day. Like literally, ALL CLASS LONG. We did this every other day - just taking turns reading from a cheap textbook that's a rip off of the free national study guide online (and which they charge over 100 dollars for). It was brutally boring. 

Every even day we stuck each other. Terrible thing was there was LITTLE detailed instruction or supervision. At one point I became worried I might have contracted something, and at another point I caught my partner reaching for a used needle to use on my arm. It was a shitshow. The teacher was more interested in shooting the shit than watching us.  

Also there was no veinviewer - they lied about that. Total hours taught were about 24 not 48. There were no capillary sticking experience provided (Which I believe is required to become nationally cert). I'm pretty sure the class cheated by taking the written exam as a group - that's what the instructor promised them. I'd left by then. 

There was this awful ""Practical exam"" at the end where you get up in front of a whole room and try and successfully obtain like 3 out of 4 tubes of blood from your partner.   It was so nerve racking and pass and failure was arbitrary. Especially considering our lack of detailed instruction, lol. 

There's more. But that's all I'll write here. Strong warning - IF YOU USE THEM IT""S 100 % NON REFUNDABLE. EVEN IF they fail to provide what they advertise.

Because Space Matters....Or Does It?,1c2cgu9,2024-04-12 15:45:40,1,1,"Introducing My Cart-Away as an innovative utility cart with the same durability as your standard utility cart with the added benefit of folding to allow for easy transport in whatever vehicle you're in, wherever you're going and the ability to store away in a truck, under a bed, in a closet or in the garage without taking up a lot of space.  Because we believe space matters.  We are looking for honest feedback on this.  Is this something you the consumer would buy.

Questions:

1. Would you purchase this cart because of the folding feature vs. a cart that doesn't fold?
2. Does the benefit of this cart's ability to fold increases your usage vs a cart that doesn't fold?
3. Have you wanted a utility cart but because it's so bulky you went a different direction for your needs?
4. Would you consider this a great addition to the marketplace?

Unfortunate Experience with Samsung.com Order and Best Buy - Seeking Advice and Potential Legal Action,18bro0f,2023-12-06 00:55:55,2,1,"Hey Reddit community,

I recently had a frustrating experience with a Samsung.com order and Best Buy, and I‚Äôm seeking advice on how to proceed. Without realizing the complications, I ordered a Samsung soundbar and TV to pick up at Best Buy, taking advantage of Samsung‚Äôs 100-day trial promotion.

During delivery, the agent dropped the TV, leaving me with a damaged product. Despite the mishap, I was told I had to either pick up both items and return the TV later or forfeit both. I opted for the former but haven‚Äôt received a refund after two weeks.

After 85 days of following up with Samsung, they informed me that I need to return both items to get a refund or lose the TV and my money due to the bundle. The soundbar has a 100-day return policy, but Best Buy refuses to accept it.

Now, Samsung customer service won‚Äôt send a return label and insists I return the items at the store. However, Best Buy won‚Äôt accept the return, creating a frustrating loop. I‚Äôve considered filing a lawsuit given the lack of resolution and have heard others facing similar issues.

Has anyone been through a similar situation, and what advice do you have? Also, if I decide to pursue legal action, would anyone be interested in joining to address these practices collectively and make things better for others?

Thanks for your insights!"

How many times will you take it? Being told one thing by a phone rep, only to be told we never told you that by another rep down the line. Corporate Gaslighting. Anything to avoid actually helping you, get you off the phone and keep your money.

'I'm sorry we have no record of that phone call'. ABSOLUTELY NO ACCOUNTABILITY. Their motto is 'fuck the customer, give us your money, go fuck yourself'.

I called in with a problem for them to tell me what to do about it. I followed their directions only to be told a few days later that I am now screwed, it's my fault, and they will not address my problem.  
I'm not even talking about how they said insurance will cost $63 but instead it cost $63 A DAY, or the out of nowhere bullshit fees.  
I'm talking about being told a double charge can be refunded upon return only to be told 'we can't address it now since you have retuned and completed your transaction'. And being left with having paid twice!! No refunds!!

"Wanted A Loan Vehicle From The Dealership When They Asked Me To Bring My 1 Year Old And LEASED Car In For A Faulty AC That Is Covered Under Warranty, And They Declined.",1e0y0jw,2024-07-11 19:55:03,0,0,"Hi Everyone, 

I'm 70% sure that this is not a legal matter, so I want to ask for advice to *officially* lodge a complaint against Hyundai for doing this - in whatever shape or way possible, be it through OMVIC, Consumer Protection Laws, etc.

I am borderline pissed. I live in Canada, I have leased a 2023 Hyundai Elantra and have been having problems with the AC since May. It can get really hot in the summer sometimes, so I decided to take my car to the dealership. I have never taken it anywhere else for repairs so that it would not void the warranty. 

Since May, I have taken the car to a Hyundai dealership TWICE and when they discovered that the car is still under warranty, they decided to play stupid games and both times, they beat around the bush for 2 hours (each visit) only to tell me that they need permission from Hyundai QA to touch the car. Both times I asked if they can take the car for now, and lend me a Loan vehicle. Both times, they declined. Why? They told me that it's because Hyundai classifies a faulty AC to be a ""convenience"" issue and not a safety issue. This ain't the Sahara but it can get upwards of 33 degrees C (91 deg F) where I am, and has happened several times this summer so far. 

They called me today and asked me to bring my car again tomorrow but this time from 8 AM to closing time, and I asked them if it can be done sooner and they told me that it cannot, because Hyundai Canada has not told them how to investigate the issue and that they need the entire day so that Hyundai Canada needs some time to understand the issue. Normally, that would piss off any kar*n, but I decided to play nice and ask politely to speak with the Manager. Manager said the same thing, so I politely asked if I could speak with his Manager, and they basically told me I cannot speak to him directly - they will have to convey my message. My Message: I simply need a loaner so I can come home and do my work and then take my car back at the end of the day. 

They said I can rent a car from them but cannot have a loaner. Again, my car is a LEASE and is a 2023 model and is under warranty. 

So I contacted another branch and they said that they don't share info between branches and that I will have to pay 155 plus tax just to get it inspected and then figured out if it is under warranty and then figure out the problem and no, I cannot have a loaner also...

I want to file a complaint against Hyundai Canada as officially as I can without sounding like an A**hole.

Thank you for hearing me out.

Edit: I just called since others are wondering the same too: Confirmed - there is NO shuttle service from this dealership"

"[Reminder] Amazon Day is a marketing event, not a deal day.",6mifa9,2023-08-13 23:29:16,1029,14901,"For those who are unaware, Amazon has been doing Prime Day, a day where they claim to have the most amount of deals for 2 years now. However, research, consumer sentiment, analysts are able to show that Prime Day is more about getting users to sign up for Prime and marketing the brand, than it is about providing deals to existing customers.

I strongly recommend you use a historical price checker like CCC or Keepa to actually verify the prices are lower, as it is a common tactic to raise prices before a sale and then trick customers into feeling like they got a deal with a large % drop, like 50% off. Also keep in mind many sites will be pushing the event despite lackluster deals, because they want people to come to their site to see the aggregated 'deals' (getting ad revenue), and some of them will be linking to Amazon for that sweet affiliate money on anything you buy.

Here are the stats:

    Comparing black friday prices to Amazon day:
    BF Prices for Laptops were 5% cheaper
    BF Prices for Small Appliances were 3% cheaper
    BF Prices for Tablets were 7% cheaper
    BF Prices for TVs were 15% cheaper
    BF Prices for Video Games were 12%
    On average prices were 9% lower on BF than prime day.
    Of 450 best-sellers, only 43 were discounted 10% or more on primeday
    Adobe's social media tracker found 50% of shoppers were disappointed, 23% felt joy
    Last year, our staff scanned nearly 8,000 deals and found only 64 worth posting.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your ideas and suggestions. I made a very long list of great meal and snack ideas. We are going to do some meal planning and seek out a food pantry in our area. 

My daughter helped her friend make an Amazon wishlist of personal items that she uses and we will be working to get try to get those for her. 

SECOND UPDATE: You all have been amazing with your suggestions and wanting to help!  I can't answer each question individually so I want to answer a few here:
 - This teen is dealing with a lot of anxiety and food insecurity at home.  She feels comfortable and safe at our house, so I will do whatever I can to make sure she is fed and safe.
 - I am working on continuing to build a relationship with her so that she feels safe enough to talk to me, if she needs to.  In the meantime, I will make sure that she has what she needs and has a safe place to come when she needs to.
 - I do not want to make her feel uncomfortable about eating here or needing anything, so I'm brainstorming ideas about how to gift things to her without her feeling awkward.

I also want to thank those who have reached out to gift things off of the wishlist that was made on her behalf!  You are allowing us to meet some of her most immediate needs and helping more than we could ever have done on our own. Thank you for caring and helping.

"Got laid off, so I went all-in on living frugally. Here's what I did.",1j58b0q,2023-08-13 23:29:16,636,12264,"Strap in, it's gonna be a long one.

In January of 2024, my second daughter was born.  Unfortunately, in the weeks leading up to my paternity leave of just 4 weeks, my company laid me off with an okay severance package (2 months of pay).  I decided during this time that after 10 years of 55+ hour weeks, I wanted a better work-life balance -- especially now that I have a second child.

Unfortunately, I had not anticipated how insane the job market was, so after hundreds of job applications, 20+ interviews, 10+ interview project assignments, and getting to the final round 5 times, I still couldn't find a job going brand-side.  I had to make a pivotal decision -- go back to agency world where I'll likely burn out sooner or later, or attempt to forge my own path with my own clients.  I decided spending time with my family was more important than a bigger paycheck, so I decided to start off on my own consulting/freelancing.

Of course, this meant that cash flow would limited for a while until I was able to build out my client base, so I set off reducing my recurring expenses as much as possible.

Platform/Service|Annual vs. Monthly|Cost|Cost per Month|Annual Cost
:--|:--|--:|--:|--:
Netflix|Monthly|$17.99|$17.99|$215.88

Chase Sapphire Reserve	|Annual	|$550.00	|$45.83	|$550.00

The above came out to $242.38/month or $2,908.61 annually.  I then cut out as much as I could then replaced the more expensive services with cheaper ones.

Stremio + RD	|Annual	|$34.54	|$2.88	|$34.54

The new recurring costs came out to $73.31/month or $879.68 annually.

* Netflix, Crunchyroll and Amazon Prime were replaced with Stremio + Real-Debrid (note: this may be a controversial move for some, but I'll be honest -- with the ever increasing subscription prices, I don't feel too bad about going the Stremio + RD route until I get back on my feet).  
* On Demand Korea was kept because my tech illiterate mother (who lives separately) has no idea how to operate anything other than a remote control to select a show and press play.

* YouTube Premium was kept if only to make sure my older child does not get exposed to random ads on her approved-only content kids profile.  But additionally, utilizing YouTube Music allowed me to get rid of Spotify.  Not gonna lie, I love Spotify's algorithm for discovering new music much better, but YouTube Music works.  Not to mention that since I work with ads as my career, I'd rather not see more ads in my personal life, and about half the content I consume is on YouTube.

* For Amazon Prime delivery, not having the instant 1-day shipping (because we would need to build up a minimum amount to get free delivery now) actually helped reduce monthly Amazon purchases.  I used to spend, on average, about $100/month on random crap.  Now it's closer to $30/month, and that's mostly essential supplies for the kiddos.

* T-Mobile was a big one.  Since my wife and I both work from home, we hardly used any data.  With Mint Mobile, not only do I get more data to use monthly, it's also significantly cheaper with no noticeable reduction in service quality (YMMV).

* I used to pay for LastPass Family, but after using Bitwarden for a while, I wonder why I didn't swap sooner.  It has basically the same functions as the LastPass Family plan to share passwords with family, but Bitwarden is not only free, but they have a much better track record of not getting hacked.

* Finally, I used to have the Chase Sapphire Reserve card as I used to travel a bit more often.  Now that that will be out of the picture for at least a year or so, I've gotten a free card that pays a higher cash back bonus on my highest spending category -- Costco (3% back on Costco with 5% back on groceries, which includes Walmart).  Also, as I now eat out or DoorDash much less frequently, I was not building up points efficiently on the CSR, so it didn't make sense to keep it.

Other things I did to reduce costs:

* Learn how to bake -- I used to buy cookies and baked goods from Costco pretty much every trip I made (every 2 weeks or so), but now I buy 0.  Instead, I am now baking all the sweet treats that my family wants.  Not only can I now get exactly what I want in the quantity that I want it, it is far, far cheaper (and tastier now that I have a bit more experience baking).  This is easily $30/month in savings.

* Learn how to cook my favorite take-out meals -- burritos, burgers, beef & bean chili, chicken noodle soup, etc.  The only time I ever order take-out now is for the party packs at McDonald's if I'm too tired to cook (once a month max), and maybe a Costco pizza.  Thankfully, I'm not a pizza snob, so I can live with cheap pizza.  This is easily $100/month in savings.

* Start a garden in my backyard -- only did this for 1 year so far, and we were able to replace some of the veggies we buy with the garden.  That said, we started off small, so we probably only saved about $50 bucks of food in the end, which was about how much spent on seeds and equipment.  We are definitely going much bigger this year (2x what we had previously) with proper equipment, so hopefully we can grow much more as we develop our green thumb.  Negligible savings so far, but I'm hoping it'll be in the $100s in savings this year.

* Apply for state help on health insurance costs -- while working at my agency, I had my entire family on my premium health insurance plan, which cost $1,600/month to cover everyone.  But now that my earnings are significantly reduced, my entire family gets health insurance completely for free.  With this cheaper health plan, even if my earnings go up significantly and I pay full price for the insurance, it'll only come out to $950/month.  That is $650/month in savings right there.  Perhaps this isn't the best long-term move because there can be problems with cheaper healthcare, but for now, as I am still ""young"", it will suffice.

All in, I am saving the following:

Item	|Old Monthly Cost	|New Monthly Cost	|Total Monthly Savings	|Total Annual Savings
:--|--:|--:|--:|--:
Subscription Services	|$242.38	|$73.31	|$169.08	|$2,028.93

My wife and I have discovered that churning meal kits has been cheaper than groceries,123nium,2023-08-13 23:29:16,677,9100,"Recently it has become more difficult for me and my wife to fit grocery shopping into our schedules with our jobs and two young kids. We decided to try some meal kits in order to still eat home cooked meals without having to spend a lot of time preparing lists and wandering grocery isles. Most companies have very attractive trial codes for 75-80% off your first delivery. So we tried that and really liked the experience. But after a few weeks the cost keeps rising up to full price and we determined that it just wasn't in the budget to do it every week.

We cancelled, thinking that we would come back maybe when they had another deal available or maybe try a different company. Well it didn't take long for a ""come back"" code to appear in my email inbox. Less than a week. So we bought another delivery at a similar extreme discount of 80%. As an experiment I decided to cancel immediately after being charged for the next box and guess what? Yep, another ""come back"" code arrived. This time via a mailed postcard.

Over the last 6 months I have bounced between two different meal kit services and I have not paid more than $3 per meal since September. As long as you cancel your subscription after each payment they will be begging you to come back within 2 weeks. I'm sure if you were really dedicated you could churn 3 or 4 different meal kits for the maximum savings. Our best streak was after the new year where we got 4 boxes in a row for $1 per meal. There is no way we could afford to buy groceries that cheap. And the meals have been great! I didn't want anyone to think this was an advertisement for a specific service, so I won't name any here. I'm very curious to find out how long I can keep this going, but so far it has been great. We only go to a small local grocer now for milk, butter, and other basics. Accounting for inflation, our total grocery budget has actually gone down despite eating better and saving time.

EDIT: Since making this post I have received another discount code for 75% off from one of our meal kit services."

Food costs are out of control in the US.,138ta5q,2023-08-13 23:29:16,1724,8271,"My partner and I live a very frugal lifestyle in a relatively HCOL area, especially when it comes to food. I make almost everything we eat from scratch using clearance and bulk ingredients, including bread, condiments, etc. We're big fans of cold cut sandwiches for lunch, and we've been buying bone-in turkey breasts, holiday hams (after the holidays) and whole roaster chickens on sale for years, freezing them until needed and prepping our own cold cuts for lunches each week. Obviously inflation has hit everyone hard, us included, but making everything from scratch has shielded us somewhat... but it's been a long, difficult week, we were out of homemade cold cuts and I decided to buy some from the deli counter at a grocery store near us last night.

I stupidly didn't check the per lb. cost, assuming it would be like, $3-4/lb like it was a few years ago‚Äì kind of expensive, but manageable. I got to the checkout and 2 lbs of normal, roast chicken deli meat from a normal grocery store cost TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS. It was almost $12/lb. That's like the cost of 4+ entire homemade meals for us.

Back to the old way, I guess... can't even cut a corner on something simple anymore. It's genuinely terrifying to know that buying too much DELI CHICKEN could be financially ruinous at this point. Where does it end?-

Edit: Some additional thoughts.

I am clearly not alone in this! This was just meant to be a ""vent"" post but clearly it's resonated. Thanks for all the helpful and supportive responses‚Äì I really hope that collectively, we can organize and DO something about the price gouging/""inflation"" happening at the supplier and retailer level. A start is contacting your state and local governments and mentioning your concerns with rising food costs and food scarcity‚Äì look up retailers or manufacturers headquartered in your area and mention those retailers by name when contacting elected officials. And, if price gouging continues and worsens, we need to be collectively ready to organize and protest.

This post is getting way more attention than I expected, and I'm getting some kind of awful comments/messages. I don't know how to caveat this any more than I did in my original post, but I know prices are high for a lot more than just deli meat, and I know deli meat is a convenience food (i.e., higher price point in general), which is why I don't normally buy it. That being said, I don't think it's an extravagant luxury, and no one should feel shamed for buying something that makes their lives easier on occasion‚Äì you can be frugal with your time and sanity sometimes, too. I feel extremely lucky that a) I have the time and equipment needed to cook frugally from scratch and b) I'm only cooking for my partner and I in a dual-income household. Everyone commenting ""stop buying deli meat then"" ‚Äì well, that's obviously my plan, but that's not really helpful commentary, it's not just deli meat, and families who rely on convenience foods shouldn't have to starve.

Final edit: The area we're located grew QUICKLY during and post-Covid when it was named ""one of the best places to live and work remote."" Housing and food costs have risen dramatically, not to mention scarcity‚Äì¬†my city made a number of ""largest COL increase"" lists the past couple of years (went from moderate to high, along with lots of other compounding factors) and my partner and I are indeed looking to move. Simply packing up and moving hours away is not attainable for everyone!"

"My wife likes to get spray tans and bikini waxes before vacations. To save money, I bought the equipment and now I do both for her.",18mjybg,2023-08-13 23:29:16,597,7831,"A few years ago, my wife came home from a Brazilian wax appointment and told me that she'd had a terrible experience. The wax was too hot, the technician (or whatever you call the waxer person) was grumpy, and a lot of hairs left behind. She said, ""Honestly, I bet you could have done it better!"" 

That gave me an idea. ""You know, I bet you that I could.""

So, I read some articles online, found the right supplies, we watched a few training videos together, and, long story short, she has never been back to another waxing salon.

It cost a couple hundred dollars for the right equipment and supplies to be able to perform each of these services, but neither was very hard to learn. It only took about 3 spray tans before I'd gotten really good at giving them. 

Brazilians were a bit more of a learning curve. I practiced waxing my own thighs for a couple of months before I attempted waxing her. I started with really small strips and the first few took forever, but now I can do one in about 25 minutes and she tells me that the results are better than any salon she ever went to.

The key for both services was purchasing professional quality equipment and supplies. I did a ton of research and tried a few different products before settling on what we found to work best.

The equipment paid for itself within 6 months. Now, each spray tan costs about $2.50 and a wax about $2-3.

My wife loves that I do them for her. She doesn't have to get naked for a stranger and she gets waxed consistently enough that it's far less painful qnd can keep a nice tan all summer with the perfect amount of color every time.

Do I enjoy providing her these services to her? Yes, I absolutely do. My wife is beautiful and I love taking care of her. However, I would not do them for her if it had not been her idea to have me learn to do them for her.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Edit: For those asking about supplies:

I order waxing stuff from Honeycomb Wax Company and spray tan solution from MineTan. Both have starter kits available. The spray gun in the MineTan starter kit isn't great. We upgraded to a gently used Norvell m1000 a few months ago and it is much better. 

Rule of thumb with equipment and supplies: You get what you pay for. As you are not paying for someone to do the application, spend up and get nice quality product (ie, professional products, not stuff from the drug store)."
"PSA: There's a real psychological cost in buying cheap crap. It can make you feel like cheap crap.

I'd also like to point out---and this isn't really an r/Frugal thought, it's just a related sidebar about the importance of good lighting to mental health, so stop reading if you hate soapboxes---Our whole experience of the world psychologically is like 70% light, 20% sound and 10% all that other shit. We're primarily light sensing creatures, in other words. The emotional timbre of your domicile's light is easily manipulated by simply getting well thought out lighting. It should be incredibly important to all of us because lighting has a profound but subtle effect on our moods. If you don't believe me, go down to your local IKEA and buy the coolest looking lamp they have. I'm sure you have five dollars. Give it a shot and make sure the bulb has a warm yellowness to it. The Scandinavians are lightyears ahead of the rest of the world in terms of good lighting and creating cozy spaces. It makes sense if you consider their countries' proximity to the Arctic Circle."

You're most likely buying something at it's regular full price that was previously marked up for days in anticipation of the ""big sale"". Unless you were already planning to purchase an item beforehand, rethink your purchase!

Edit: I think I need to clarify my last sentence. It's for sure a deal if you were already premeditating to buy an item anyway, like a gift, consumable good, or thing you already had an eye on.

"As a former Sears appliance technician, I take phenomenal care of my appliances and I‚Äôll never have to buy brand new. Here‚Äôs why...",j05ioi,2023-08-13 23:29:16,781,7267,"I worked for Sears appliance repair and have troubleshot most appliances around the house. I cannot count how many times I have heard customers complain about buying a pair of brand new washing machine/dryer sets and wishing they had their old set back. Not only this, but I‚Äôve picked up the tricks to making appliances last. After having worked on the newer ones vs older, used appliances, this is what I‚Äôve learned:

1. DON‚ÄôT USE TOO MUCH SOAP!! People make this mistake all the time. Especially with washing your clothes, brands will sell you a detergent with the cap that has measurements on it. Never use these measurements. Even the lowest measurement is too much. If you are washing a normal sized load of laundry, all you need is 1 tablespoon of detergent. Yes, you read that correctly. Towels/blankets can use maybe 2 tablespoons. The reason for this is because most marketed detergents will have a little sticker on it that says ‚ÄúHE‚Äù. This means it is high efficiency, or in other words really really really really concentrated soap. 1 tablespoon of HE detergent is equal to about 1/4-1/2 cup of soap. If you were to add 1/2 cup of HE soap, it creates an over abundant amount of suds for your washer. Too many suds can cause balance displacement and mess up your suspension. If you have a washer that senses the moisture content of the clothes, the extra suds can cause your washer to work overtime to get rid of them. This causes the motor/shaft to wear out faster. The extra oil in the suds can also trickle down easier into the shaft and cause rust. Lastly, too much detergent will cause more mildew build up between the tub and basket of the washer.  

2. That being said, never ever ever buy Tide Pods. They are expensive and will wreck your washer/dishwasher. Too much detergent.

3. Never use dryer sheets. They will coat your lint trap with wax and ultimately cause house fires. 
Also, get your dryer cleaned often! Lint doesn‚Äôt always stick to the lint trap. It can escape and get into the heating element, causing it to light up into flames. Open up the dryer and vacuum out the lint, or use a wet rag to wipe it up.

4. The salesman is quick to sell you on all the new gadgets, functions, and color of the appliance. DO NOT LISTEN TO HIM/HER! Say you are on the market for a washer/dryer. The big boy sets will have any function you want. It‚Äôll have crazy settings specifically for bedding, towels, whites, delicates, self cleaning. Looks awesome... but in fact this is pointless. If you go this route, you‚Äôll end up buying a brand new washer with 20 settings that you NEVER touch. Most people only use the Normal and Heavy setting on their washer, and trust me these 2 settings will wash your clothes just fine. Same with a dryer: most people only use sensing dry or timed dry. There is almost no practical use for any of the other settings when they do the exact same function as your most normal setting. 

5. The newer appliances combine plastic and metal moving parts, which cause the need for more repairs. The older appliances are made mostly of metal and last forever if you take care of them. I find that older people hang on to their appliances for longer and it always seems to have gone in their favor. I have worked on their 20+ year old washers and dryers they‚Äôve had since the 90s, and in my experience they wash/dry better than any new appliance on the market. Plus, over the duration of their life, they have had little to no repair needed on them. If you can get your hands on an old washer/dryer, I highly recommend it!

6. Older appliances still have replacement parts on the market, and they are cheap. You can buy mostly anything you need to repair the machine with the exception of cosmetics (the outer shell, sometimes handles, main display and buttons).

7. Take care of your appliance. Once a month you should be running a cleaner in your washer/dishwasher. Buy any cleaner at the store and you‚Äôll increase the longevity of the appliance just by doing this. 

8. Do not buy Samsung or LG appliances. They are terrible and made of mostly computers. If something breaks, that computer part will cost you an arm and a leg. Make sure to get a warranty if you really want this brand. 

The only exception to not buying brand new would be a refrigerator. I would buy one brand new because every few years, they can change up the refrigerant used. The newer refrigerants are more environmentally friendly. Plus, if they can stay colder for longer, you can save electricity from it having to run the compressor as long. 

Overall, following these steps will save so much money in the long run it‚Äôs not even funny. Using less soap will ensure your clothes still get clean, but literally double the life you get out of a bottle of detergent.

EDIT: I should mention;  if you have high efficiency washers, then using HE detergent at its proper measurements is generally okay. HE washers use less water and the concentration of the detergent is meant for this purpose. Although, I would still use a tad bit less than recommended. 

FIRE WARNING‚Äî the dryer sheets themselves do not cause fires. The wax from your dryer sheets sticks to the lint trap. When the wax has built up over time and the trap no longer catches the lint, that lint has to go somewhere. It will escape through any crease it finds. The lint shoots into the open cabin of the dryer, touching the heating element. Lint is EXTREMELY flammable. The heating element will light it on fire and any other lint in the dryer. This is how house fires are cause by dryers."

PSA: Bedbugs are insanely expensive to deal with and frankly traumatizing to live with. Here are some tips.,drodiu,2023-08-13 23:29:16,637,6782,"A few years ago my wife and I lived in an apartment that got bedbugs. A lot of this might seem excessive or crazy but trust me you don't want to chance this stuff.

1. Whenever you come home from someone's apartment or a hotel stay, immediately put all fabrics (clothes, luggage, sleeping bags) into the **dryer**. Even if you can't see any bugs, the eggs are too small to see and can live in fabrics for up to a year. 

2. If you have an expensive mattress, get a bedbug liner. My wife and I had to throw out a 6 month old $1,200 mattress because we didn't spend $25 on a cover. It's really not worth trying to salvage the mattress once its infested, even if you kill all the live bugs you still need to worry about eggs.

3. Don't waste your money on ""natural"" products to kill bed bugs. We tried several and they were straight up ineffective. Rather than buying products that are safe for pets, just buy products that actually work and keep your pets away from the affected areas until you've cleaned up. 

4. If you're going to buy furniture off craigslist (which I will no longer do) try to avoid apartments. No this isn't a stereotype against low income people, the problem is that it's basically impossible to clear a building of bedbugs unless the whole building is treated. Most apartment complexes will try to treat on a unit-by-unit basis which just doesn't work. In addition the risk of re-infestation is high because a lot of infestations start by people bringing bugs home from school or work. More people = higher probability of bedbugs.

5. Do not let your landlord try to bully you into keeping a security deposit if you are leaving a place that is infested with bedbugs. We had this happen since we didn't try and salvage their wall to wall carpet. They tried to charge us $500 plus our deposit to fix the carpet. Eventually it ended up in collections but after providing state mandated guidelines on dealing with bedbug infested apartments, they backed off, gave the deposit back, and it never ended up on our credit report."

Is anyone noticing an uptick in shady behavior by companies?,14kis3z,2023-08-13 23:29:16,1167,6732,"The era of free money is over. Companies can't depend on raising vast amounts of cash from investors for free anymore --so they're squeezing us instead with shady behavior. 

In May I canceled my Netflix subscription. They sent me an email confirmation. I felt like I had already canceled, but could not dig up the confirmation email. This morning I look at my bank statement and there's a $20 charge from Netflix. Had to call them up to get a refund, and they were gaslighting me saying maybe I had restarted without being aware (zilch chance of that I don't have time to watch it or interest) or that someone has my password (again zilch chance of that as I'm the only user of my laptop and I had changed my password already when canceling in May). 

T-mobile has been even worse. My mom was going abroad for a few weeks and she asked me to add an extra line to my account as they have good international coverage. Turns out instead of adding a single extra line, which I directly and clearly and empathically requested of them despite their INSISTENT sales pitch that I had more ""free"" lines they added **4 extra lines to my account** . When she returned, I had all the lines canceled except my own. Or so I thought. Turns out that t-mobile canceled only 3 of the extra lines and kept an additional on my account. I was paying $147 per month for months due to that extra line, when I should have been paying $50. They basically pocketed hundreds of dollars in extra fees without my permission and despite multiple documented phone calls to them to cancel and switch me to a single line. 

WOW! Now I'm thinking of reaching out to the FCC.

But this stuff is endless. I'm now finding that im spending a lot of extra time worrying and correcting shady behaviors like this. Another company I discovered today automatically renewed my membership to a video editing software that was advertised as a one-time purchase. 

I suggest everyone look carefully at your bank statements and create a system to identify and reach out to any company that might have your payment information.

If a show was coming to town that I wanted to see I'd hop on the artists webpage until I found a press or management contact. I would email in, explain who I was and where I went to school, and ask if they'd like me to hang flyers around campus. Fairly often they would say yes, send me a PDF and tell me the would comp me a ticket.

Ordering takeout or delivery directly from the restaurant is 15% cheaper on average than ordering from 3rd party delivery apps,lwf6ko,2023-08-13 23:29:16,403,5916,"You are probably wasting money on 3rd party delivery apps for the same food and service you can get from the restaurant directly.

The 3rd party delivery apps such as DoorDash, Uber Eats and Grubhub charge several kinds of fees on top of the original food price. Specifically, they charge the following for a delivery order:

1. The price of the menu items - for many restaurants, this price is not the original price on their own menus. There can be inflated menu price, as much as 20% higher.
2. The service fee - 15% of the food price (including the inflated price). Uber Eats caps the service fee at $5 max (and $2.50 min), DoorDash and Grubhub have no cap.
3. The delivery fee - depending on the distance, different platforms charge different delivery fees. DoorDash charges $2.99 - $6.99, Uber Eats $0.49 - $3.99, Grubhub $1.99 - $5.99.
4. Other fees - for example, the ""CA driver benefits"" is a fee charged by some of the 3rd party delivery companies in California because the driver's payment is higher in CA. Uber Eats charges $2.00, Grubhub charges $2.00 - $4.00 depending on the distance, DoorDash doesn't charge this fee.

Considering all these together, guess how much you would pay for a $50 family meal? Let's assume the inflated menu price is +10%, and you are at the max distance of the delivery radius.  
\- DoorDash: $50\*110%\*115%+$6.99 = $70.24  
\- UberEats: $50\*110%+$5+$3.99+$2 = $65.99  
\- Grubhub: $50\*110%\*115%+$5.99+$4.00 = $73.24

That's too much, isn't it? And guess how much you would pay for the same meal if ordering directly from the restaurant? It depends on which online ordering company the restaurant partners with. But most of the time, the restaurant doesn't charge any service fees, and never has inflated menu prices. So you would always pay the original price with some delivery fees. The delivery fee sometimes can be a little bit higher than the 3rd parties, but the overall price is much lower. Take the same $50 meal example, most likely you would only pay$50+$7 = $57where the $7 is the delivery fee if the restaurant uses ChowNow.

Now you know that the price difference can be HUGE between the restaurant's own channel and 3rd party delivery apps. In addition, the restaurant pays 25%-30% commission per order if you place the order through 3rd party delivery apps. The restaurant loses money definitely if all orders go through the 3rd party apps.

So, if you ever want to order takeout or delivery, please consider placing the orders through the restaurant's own channel. You can go to the restaurant's website, for they usually put a link there to let you place the order online. I know it is a bit inconvenient, but it saves a lot of money for yourself and the restaurants you like. Also, there are some websites that are trying to make it easy for people to order directly from the restaurants, such as Hyperflyer. On that website, you can compare the prices of multiple delivery services side-by-side and see how much you can save if ordering through the cheapest one (most of the time, the restaurant's own channel). It has the links directing you to the ordering websites of the restaurants, so you don't have to search each restaurant's website by yourself.

Of course, it's all up to you to decide how to order food online, but I think you should at least know the numbers and consider before you make the decision."

"I garden and cook a lot. One of the coolest things I've learned combining these interests is how much edible stuff you can grow from grocery store leftovers. This is a list of 12 useful herbs and veggies I have personally grown from grocery store scraps/seeds, so I know they work.",lh5sco,2023-08-13 23:29:16,296,5642,"But don't let this list limit you. The ultimate moral here is most food scrap seeds and fresh cuttings can be planted or cloned. In hindsight, I feel like that should be an obvious statement, but it's really not in the modern day. It kind of blew my mind how much of the stuff you buy at the grocery store can be planted for fun and profit when I first started to get into gardening. 

And just FYI, cloning plants is far more difficult with some plant species than internet articles describing how to clone them make out. Most internet articles act like you can clone anything if you just put a cutting in a cup of water. In practice, only some types of plants actually clone that way reliably. You kind of have to develop a technique for each. Biggest universal principle I've learned is that the area you want to take root should be kept in the dark as much as possible. That usually means putting some kind of collar (e.g. peat moss or rockwool) around the stem and putting it in an opaque and covered container with water so only the top half of the plant with the leaves gets light.

**Grocery store stuff I've grown plants from:**

1.	Pinto beans ‚Äì Grown from a bag of dried Goya pinto beans. Just plant the beans like you would from a seed packet. They sprouted in a few days. I assume it would work with other varieties of bean, but pinto are the only ones I‚Äôve tried.

2.	Basil ‚Äì Can be cloned from fresh herb cuttings bought in the produce aisle. Clones quite easily in just a glass of water. I‚Äôve had roots pop in a literally just two days with rooting hormone added (a virtually unlimited supply can be bought for about $5 on the internet), though it tends to vary a lot based on the quality of the cutting.

3.	Peppers ‚Äì Seeds inside fresh peppers generally sprout as easily as garden store seeds. You might have less luck with green bell peppers and jalapenos since they‚Äôre picked when not ripe though. I‚Äôve successfully grown habaneros, cherry peppers, sweet peppers, and long finger peppers from grocery store seeds.

4.	Mint ‚Äì Can be cloned from cuttings. Try to use the less woody stems, as they‚Äôll be more likely to root. I found mint moderately difficult to clone. I took 5 cuttings. 2 rooted, but only 1 survived. Once you have a healthy plant, it‚Äôs easy to transfer it to another container by burying the runners in the new container.

5.	Rosemary ‚Äì Can be cloned from cuttings. Rosemary is pretty difficult to clone. I took 10 cuttings and only 1 survived. It took about 1-2 months to root too. I‚Äôd probably buy an aeroponic cloner if I was going to try clone more of this. You get better results when the part of the stem you‚Äôre trying to root is kept in the dark. I did this to an extent with rockwool collars, but it‚Äôs still a race for the plant to root before the leaves and stem start to rot.

6.	Blueberries ‚Äì I‚Äôve grown blueberry plants from frozen aisle blueberries. If you have fresh blueberries you‚Äôll want to stratify the seeds by keeping them in the freezer for 60 days to simulate winter. You can skip this with frozen blueberries though. Keep in mind growing blueberries from seed takes a while. The plants are pretty easy to take care of once sprouted. Only real caveats are use acidic soil and keep it moist at all times. They‚Äôll have to grow for about 2 years before they start producing berries, and they won‚Äôt get up to full rate production for 3-5 years.

7.	Garlic ‚Äì You can plant whole cloves. Put them about an inch deep in the soil, skin on, pointy side up and water when soil is dry. They‚Äôll sprout in a week or two under ideal conditions. You can harvest them after they‚Äôve grown for about a month for ‚Äúgreen garlic‚Äù which looks and is used like green onions, but has a more garlicky taste (though milder than regular garlic). You can also just let them grow into bulbs. If you do that you‚Äôll want to plant them in the fall, let them go through winter and then harvest in the next summer.

8.	Green onions ‚Äì The white ends can be planted if you leave the little root nubs on. I usually leave about an inch of the white part on what I‚Äôm cutting. The more white you leave the higher the chance of success and give you a more robust plant (though the success rate is very high regardless).

9.	Carrots ‚Äì Carrot plants can be grown by planting the fat end of a carrot. Plant the flat side down and the round end up, with the round end sticking slightly out of the soil. I should note, while I‚Äôve successfully grown carrot plants like this, I‚Äôve never gotten a full-sized carrot from doing it. I presume it‚Äôs possible, but clones grown in this way don‚Äôt always have the same potential as growing from seed.

10.	Romaine lettuce ends ‚Äì Put the end of the romaine head in a glass of water and new leaves will sprout up. Note that when you do this you‚Äôre never going to get a full head out of it (at least I never have) the way you would with seed. It‚Äôll get about half-sized and then bolt. What I do is save the ends in the fridge until I have like 6 and then plant them all at once. When each have about 6-8 decent-sized leaves I‚Äôll harvest them and combine into a single salad. The lettuce will taste sweeter than mature lettuce because it will all be young.

11.	Tomatoes ‚Äì Seeds from store bought tomatoes can be grown. Keep in mind most store bought tomatoes are F1 hybrids (except heirloom tomatoes), so the seeds you plant might not produce tomatoes that look exactly like the ones you got the seeds from. I‚Äôve heard the same is true of peppers, as well, though all the peppers I‚Äôve ever grown from grocery store seeds end up looking just like their parents.

12.	Potatoes ‚Äì Can be grown by letting eyes form on a potato and planting that. Cut the potato up so each chunk you plant has at least 3 eyes on it."

"Finally paid off $10,000 of credit card debt! Thank you r/frugal! Here are my biggest takeaways.",bfegnu,2023-08-13 23:29:16,261,5541,"I joined Reddit last July after maxing out two $5,000 credit cards and realizing I needed a change. I took up frugal habits learned from here and similar subreddits and after nine months, I'm finally debt-free! (I'm young and don't make a lot, so it took some time) Here are some of my biggest takeaways.

&#x200B;

1. THERE'S NO SHAME IN ASKING FOR HELP -  While I didn't get financial help, I told my family and friends about my situation, and that anything we could do to keep things inexpensive would be appreciated. Instead of going out to dinner and to the movies, I played tons of basketball with friends, started inviting people over for home-cooked meals, and had many cheesy-movie nights with friends. This adds up FAST and saves big money, and having support from loved ones cheering me on to pay things off made a huge difference.
2. IT'S AMAZING WHAT YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR - Let's take body wash as an example. I was paying over $4 a bottle for the Dove men's soap. I went to Walmart and bought the cheapest soap I could find ($0.99) which was awful. I took a step up to the $1.50 Suave men's stuff and it worked excellent. I did this with everything I bought. I bought the cheapest version, and worked my way up until the quality was acceptable. More often than not, the cheapest thing is just fine!
3. IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT - Here's an unconventional example of this. I like video games, but realized that this wasn't a wise use of money when in debt. Instead of buying new games, I milked the ones I had for their full enjoyment. I've played nothing but Mario Kart 8, Splatoon 2, and Smash Ultimate for the past year and have bought no new games (except Smash when it came out) and have milked an incredible amount of hours (and value) out of them. No need to buy new games if you love the ones you have! This applies to many other items. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.

&#x200B;

Thank you /r/frugal for all the tips. I was a just lurker, but I still felt like I wasn't alone. I'm hoping these habits will lead to future financial well-being!"
How to Travel in Japan cheaply - quick notes.,7p9ish,2023-08-13 23:29:16,341,5539,"I read a lot from people about how expensive Tokyo and Japan in general is... we went to several cities, saw lots of sights, and while I would say it is far more expensive than, say, Mexico or something, it was still really cheap. So I thought I'd put together some quick tips to save money while out in Japan: 

- Biggest expensive is the flight itself. Use Scott's Cheap Flights if you are a frequent traveler (or sign up for free and get occasional emails if not) to help find cheap flights to the country. We bought our tickets for $450 round trip. 

- Use hostels, APA Hotels, etc. Hostels are the cheapest way to stay in Japan, and they are quite nice. We stayed in several, and if you book early you can get some really amazing ones that are gorgeous for cheap. They also have the benefit of local knowledge and lots of flyers of local events coming up. We attended a festival our second day we had no idea was going on. We actually browsed on hotels.com as well, scored an APA hotel in Kanazawa for less than the price of both of us staying at a hostel--and it came with roof-top bathing. (EDIT: It has been pointed out that APA hotels may be owned by some unsavory people. Business Hotels in general, something APA is, are cheap nice hotels that get the job done, so if you want more ethical purchases, you might steer clear of APA.) 

- Pack LIGHTLY. A backpack should be the most you are carrying because there is LOTS of walking in Japan; if you want to visit several cities like we did, you'll have your work cut out for you. You can get taxis and such, but that's part of what drives the cost up, and you don't want to be lugging tons of luggage on trains either. Hostels have laundry services many times, so you can wash clothes during the trip. 

- Get a Japan Rail Pass. This is THE BEST way to tour Japan and it is super cheap for tourists to do so. Taking a bullet train from Kyoto to Tokyo takes literally ZERO more dollars thanks to this pass, you can flash it as you walk by like Leeloo Dallas. It can seem expensive up front, but once you get there and realize how much it would cost just to wander around Tokyo, you realize how cheap and valuable this thing is. (EDIT: There is a lot of controversy apparently about this pass! I absolutely found it worth while and worth the money spent. It took a lot of the ""I need to plan everything right to spend my money accordingly"" out of the equation, and I didn't worry about catching the wrong trains or if we could afford to go to x city last minute or not. If train travel is an anxious thing for you, I definitely recommend this as it makes everything much easier.) 

- Konbinis are everywhere. Convenience stores (shortened to Konbini) have cheap food and we mostly used these for breakfast (if the hostel did not have one) and lunches. We got dinner at ramen shops, street food, conveyor belt sushi shops, small mom-and-pop shops, chain curry shops, etc. but you can shave a lot off of your food expenses with these. They actually have LOTS of healthy food in them. Many Americans are wired to think 'gas station style' stop-and-gos are full of fried food... these have that, but also healthy sandwiches, onigiri, etc. We kept our food costs waaay down thanks to these shops. The key is, Eat Japanese Food. If you eat specialty foods they will cost more than bento boxes, onigiri, etc. 

- Gardens are everywhere, and free to do for the most part. Small donations are encouraged (and we always did) but it costs very little to go see gorgeous quiet gardens. If your travel buddy wants to see the hustle of Harajuku and the noise and crowd is just too much, a HUGE garden is literally across the street and is somehow instantly quiet. 

- Carry cash on you. You need lots of it in Japan, and everything is very much so still cash-based wherever you go. 

- There are cities that are less expensive than others too! Takayama, for example, is gorgeous, thriving culture and community with SO much to do, and it is far cheaper than the heart of Tokyo. You can even get a cheap Ryokan ($75ish a person vs over $150-200 as the standard price) there (look up Nomadic Nerd's article on it as that's how we found it) there and have a beautiful luxury evening and meals included. I think we would have spent more if we stayed in just Tokyo. Kanazawa has lovely Geisha and Samurai districts. Matsumoto has one of the oldest castles ever. etc. 

- Stay away from Tokyo's big tourist traps. Robot Restaurant, for example, is a big one, but there are a lot of tourist traps in Tokyo where those areas tend to jack up the prices. This is true for most tourist areas of course. (EDIT: Hahaha this was ALSO a big point of debate! Some people really liked the outlandishness of it all, some people found it uncomfortable. For me, definitely, the whole area it was in + the RR itself was awful and a waste of money.... Thoough, I more enjoyed the gardens, temples, street vendors, etc. So take it for what it's worth and try it out if it sounds good to you. Don't take my word for anything, I may have different tastes than you!) 

- The airports and train stations actually have some cool souvenirs. If you're waiting to buy souvenirs or seem to have forgotten some last minute, the airport (and the train stations) actually isn't totally overpriced like you'd find in the states. You can get insanely cute cakes and such that make great take-home souvenirs without having to carry them everywhere with you the whole trip. 

- If you're looking for a cheap Yukata or Kimono to take home, consider stopping by Chicago second hand store in Harajuku. I bought 2 yukatas for $20 each and 1 obi that matched both of the for around the same price. Tokyu Hands is an insane department store in Tokyo (EDIT: Rightly pointed out, not JUST in Tokyo, but there IS one in Tokyo) that has floors of cool gifts and stuff--I bought a couple terrific bento boxes from there. 

- If you have a job where you use pens a lot, consider buying some in Japan! Im a nurse, and use different color pens to help organize everything, and Japan had my back with awesome professional looking combo-color pens. 

Anyways, that's all I got, feel free to add more here in the comments too! 

EDIT: There absolutely IS a whole subreddit about traveling to this amazing country and I recommend checking it out before you go. 

EDIT 2: People were asking about my budget. 

It was $3,500 for 2 people for 2 weeks. 

I only spent $2,500 in Japan itself including the flights. 

The flights were $450 each from San Fran to Narita. A small part of why the flights were cheaper was because we got free flights to San Francisco from the East Coast (I have a friend that works in the airport and I did her a solid, so she repayed me with that.) However, South West has cheap flights in country in the US, and I would recommend catching a flight to the West coast and trying to fly to Japan from there to save loads of money on the flight. We were going to do this and book the flights for around $100-200 (I can't remember, somewhere between those numbers) one way when we got the free deal as an option. Still, $1,300 for both people to fly is pretty cheap! We did spend slightly outside of that budget in China, but we had overnight lay-overs in China 2 nights (one there, one back). I did not include that in here because we chose that lay-over over direct flights, and we could have slept in the airport, but opted to get out and sight see. 

The hotels/hostels costed around $10-20 a night depending on where we stayed. 

We spent around $10 (mostly close to $10) a day each on food. I count some odd ball luxury items food-wise as 'entertainment' if we were there for other purposes (historical site, or something like that) so some of that IS in our activities fund, but this is probably 10/14 days worth. Hostels with breakfast included FTW.

The JRP was ~$200 a person. "
I quit a well paying job that I love because of this sub.,ce6sh9,2023-08-13 23:29:16,213,5537,"You guys inspired me to take a pay cut and quit a job I once thought I would retire from, in the name of frugality. 

For the past five years I've had a job that I love, I get paid ridiculously well and I have great benefits, it's a good culture etc. etc. But over time,  Ive felt increasingly anxious and dissatisfied with the job and until recently I wasn't sure why.

I've kind of always been aware that my time even off the company clock has monetary value, and so sometimes I will pay more for something that saves a lot of time, or I will forgo money-saving measures that take too much time. But this sub has led me to take that time-frugal mindset to the next level. 

First, by teaching me that quality time with loved ones is even more valuable than regular time. So many of the comments on this sub about saving time mention using that time to be with family and friends. 

Secondly, by teaching me to look even deeper into budgeting and decision making when it comes to opportunity costs. Sometimes you can be doing great and making money and saving money but simultaneously preventing yourself from being even greater and saving and making even more money. 

So when I was commuting over an hour each way in my personal vehicle and getting home past my daughter's bedtime and working every weekend, even though I was enjoying myself at work and thought the generous compensation was worth it, I was really losing out in the long term. I was burning out at work and burning up my car and burning through the short times I had with her by being exhausted. 

Today I took an offer which is a pay cut to have a schedule and a work location which will allow me to drop off and pick up my daughter at school every single day of the week. That is more valuable than I can express. Thanks for helping me save my time, sanity, and relationship with my daughter, r/Frugal!"

I spent about 8 years paying the minimum on my loans holding out for the Public Service Loan Repayment. I mostly paid interest for that time, banking on the loan repayment program to eventually swoop in and cancel my debt because I've worked in non-profits with homeless and drug addicted populations for the last almost 9 years.

Well we all now know that repayment program is a government scam and has only approved **95** people out of the *33,000* people that have applied, so I started diligently hustling to throw every cent I can at my loans and as of this month, I'm below $10,000! It's not the biggest milestone, but 4-digit debt versus 5-digit debt is so exciting!!!

To get to this place I've worked 1-2 extra jobs (canvassing, working nights at a homeless shelter), sold art designs online (only about $300 a month but it helps), stopped eating out and buying coffees, selling stuff (like the Apple Watch I almost never used) and asked for (and GOT!) a raise at my job.

I actually just got hired for a seasonal job through the holidays, and 100% of that paycheck will go towards my loans until I'm DONE! Thanks to this sub and others for the information and support!"

I grew up very poor, and when I achieved middle-income status, I started compensating for all those years.  It turned out to be a huge mistake.

I had much more peace of mind and was happier when I parked my 5k car; I never worried about it being damaged in the parking lot, and I didn't care if I scratched it a bit, etc. Now that I own a 40k car, I am not any happier, just more worried.

The same thing happened with my mobile phone. I was careless and relaxed with my ‚Ç¨200 Xiaomi. Now I treat the S24 Ultra like it is made of paper because it is so expensive, and I worry about damaging it.

I will not sell the things I have bought until now, but I am sure as hell driving this car for at least 15 more years and keeping this phone for at least 5 more years (those are just two examples).

Those are just my random thoughts. Material things, shinier and better, really don't fulfill me. I still feel poor at heart."

But the price of fast food is completely out of hand these days. Almost $20 for a meal for one person. It has gotten absolutely ridiculous.

But I have a better idea frozen pizza. I keep a few in my freezer for days I just don't want to cook real food. Popping one in the oven for 10-20 is no less convenient than the drive through line and it's significantly cheaper. Even the nice frozen pizzas like Red Barron are about half the price of a full meal from a fast food place. The cheapest frozen pizzas like the little Kroger brand cost as little as 2 bucks, that is less than the cost of making real food."

Honey is useless. It just gathers your data to sell ads.,s8y4j1,2023-08-13 23:29:16,490,5180,"ive had honey installed for YEARS now. I virtually ONLY shop online and i have never ONCE had it enter a code that worked. I shop on ebay/amazon/every online food store you can think of/online relailers/kogan/costco and the list goes ON AND ON.

Not once had it EVER given me a code that worked. It seems like its just a  scam to gather your meta data. They claim they dont ""sell"" user's data but this doesnt mean they dont gather meta data etc. I must have made a thousands purchases from countless global brands and it has NEVER worked once.

Anyone else had this experience?"

"Every year my dad make 150$-300$ by picking up cans on the side of the road when he walks, and we arnt even in a state that has can deposit.",934l4t,2023-08-13 23:29:16,406,5152,"So by just carrying a bag and picking up cans and such my dad makes somewhere between 150-300$ a year for doing just about nothing. It's such a range because he stores the cans in a few boxes and when the boxes are full he takes them in to the recycling center. He crushes the cans with his sledge and saves them in the garage. It's a super easy way to make some cash and makes you feel really good for helping the environment. Now we live in a state that doesn't have a can deposit so each can is only worth 1-2cents. In a state with can deposits you could easily get 5x the amount.  If your into this idea check out r/detrashed. Being frugal and enviromentally active often go hand and hand.

Edit: wow 15 comments in 20 ish min with no upvote yall are frugal with them Internet points  too haha

Edit 2: all of you act like this is the biggest time sink in the world it literally is just a couple of second. Also common theme. MOST CANS ON THE ROAD ARNT STICKY OR SMELLY. Seriously people the cans get rained on which gets rid of most of the residue, any residue is eaten off by ants that leave the can as soon as the food runs out. And for those few cans that are gross just avoid those ones!  Lastly, what else do you do when you get home?! My dad and I like to bike ride and walk so we do this while doing that. It's either this or watching TV on our asses  so even the very small amount of time we do this is still being spent in an effecient way as any other way we would spend it would be nothing"

Add 4 cups water, 1 cup old fashioned oats, a pinch of salt, and 1/2-1 tsp of sweetener (you can also add some vanilla if you feel), and blitz with an immersion blender. Strain out the oat clumps (I use a regular old kitchen strainer and store in a jar. The process takes about 2 minutes total. You will need to shake it before using as it will separate. Lasts about a week in the fridge.

Edit: As folks have pointed out, if you're drinking oat milk to get vitamins/calcium, those won't be present. I find the consistency great for cereal, smoothies, baking, etc, but wouldn't add it to coffee, so YMMV on this recipe. Have fun!"

7 random things I do to be Frugal,18w2m6x,2023-08-13 23:29:16,371,4964,"1) I live in wifi 99% of the time.  Most cell phone plans are under $10 for 1GB of data.  Tello starts at $5

2) Bunny Ears / Antenna provide over 20 channels of great content. ABC, NBC, Fox, CBS, and more for free.

3) The library is not your library of the 90s.  From PS5 games to great movies.  Check out weekly for tons of free entertainment. 

4) Cash ""Stings"" more than swiping a card.   If you want to stick to a budget, hand over cash on your impulse buys and feel that sting.   Studies show, even on 0% interest cards, you spend 20% more when swiping.   Save money buy feeling the money leave your hands. 

5) When going to live events, football games/concert.  Park and wait until the game starts.  I have seen tickets drop from $150 to $8 multiple times by just missing the kickoff and then walking in.   We have set in seats on a premier concert which started at $500 ticket, missed the opening act and got in for under $60.  Big Ten College basketball games for under $4 ticket after fees..  People panic when selling 3rd party tickets after the event starts.   Enjoy the main act and save up to 95%. 

6) Designate a ""no spend month"" twice a eyar.  February is a good place to start with fewer days.  Use every single thing in your house to eat, look for coupons, eat rice and beans.  Try to live like you've never lived 2 out of 12 months and it really helps. 

7) Panera Sip Club.  Sign ups usually give you 3 months free and next 3 at a discount when you sign up.  If you live within a couple of miles,  get large drinks without ice and take home.  You can get Coffee, Iced Coffee, Tea, Iced Tea, Soda, Bubbly, etc.   Go a couple times a day and have plenty of drinks to share without the ice or have multiple times.   An Iced Coffee with my own ice, makes 5 cups of my own cups.   Full price is $11.99/month. I have been a customer for a year and yet to have paid that much.  Probably spent $3,000 in retail pricing.

8 years and $36k in credit card debt finally paid off!,7x1nbq,2023-08-13 23:29:16,268,4887,"https://imgur.com/a/EAlOF


It has been a **long** trip to where I am today when I made my lat credit card payment. I accrued significant credit card debt in college (not student loans) and then after getting married with a very crappy job, and basically living on credit cards. I was living on the east coast, paying a ridiculous amount of money for a tiny apartment and general cost of living. Since my job was work at home, I made the decision to find a nice community in the midwest and relocated. My monthly housing cost dropped from $1500 down to $500  - i went from a tiny apartment, to owning a 4-bedroom ranch. My overall cost of living also went down significantly. This allowed me to start paying more than the minimums on my cards. Surprisingly, my credit was excellent so over the last 8 years, I was able to move around the balance every 12 months to a 0 interest balance transfer card, so I paid very little interest on this balance.(other than 2-3% BT fees). I have also learned so much from this sub about frugal living, which further contributed to my ability to pay down my debt, and build a $15k emergency fund."

This probably would have cost me hundreds of dollars if not thousands!!! Everyone should have a dash cam because you just never know what might happen, especially when it's not your fault.

I bought one for $40 on amazon. You can easily find a cheap one there. If you would like any suggestions, just message me!

If you have the money to buy a really good house then yes it's better than renting. If you can do the work yourself (like I do), yes it's better than renting. If you aren't making big money and also aren't handy, you should rethink how owning a home is so much better than renting.

Edit: Some have mistaken this post for me advocating against home ownership. That's absolutely not the case. It works for me because I can do the repairs myself. I'm merely explaining that if I made the same income but didn't have handy skills, it would be a total sinkhole. 

I made this post because I see a lot of low-income individuals looking at home ownership like it's an escape from overpaying on rent. The costs to own are far more than the mortgage payment alone. Either you have the money to absorb the costs or you have the skills to do the work yourself. "

If you are going to toe the line between frugal and cheap at least be pleasant about it.,101imkg,2023-08-13 23:29:16,572,4768,"I will start by saying I've had to be ridiculously careful with my money when I was younger and remember how much it sucked. Like living in my car for weeks and only eating what was left on bussed plates at work broke. But I never made it anyone else's problem or acted an ass about it. So my tolerance is 0 for people who are assholes because they feel they deserve to be. 





That being said, on to the story. I was at the store NYE picking up some things to enjoy with my boyfriend for the holiday and decided I'd like to tack on some crab legs. At the seafood counter was a woman already fighting with the employee at the case. He was apologizing stating that he has to serve the meat as it is and she was looking at him like he'd just slapped her in the face. My curiosity did get the better of me so I stood right behind her. They argued back and forth for a bit, her screaming she shouldn't have to pay by weight for parts she can't eat and him apologizing, stating policy and trying to just get her through the line now that three of us were standing there waiting. You guys... This bitch was trying to get him to remove the tails of the $11lb shrimp before weighing it. That might get you what, 2 extra shrimp? I was gobsmacked. I understand when you want something out of budget and are desperate to find a way to splurge but what the absolute fuck. Eventually a manager came out and stepped to the side with her while the poor guy just getting chewed on had to throw his game face back on and serve the rest of the customers. There was maybe a pound and a half of shrimp left and I seriously debated getting petty and just buying it to end the bullshit still raging next to me but decided against it. She was still bitching as I left the counter. People like that make their own lives harder and then take it out on others because they have a hard life. Just pisses me right off. 





TLDR/Moral of the story, pick your battles. Cut costs and corners where you can but not if it will negatively impact others. Checking if maybe you can have a discount on a dented can? Frugal win! Demanding the poor counter clerk de-tail 30 shrimp for you to save pennies? Cheap loser."

My plan before I called them was 60Mbps for $75.

Right now in my city (Columbus Ohio) there is kind of a bidding war with internet pricing.  Spectrum bought out time warner not long ago and their prices are rock bottom trying to get WOW customers to switch to them.

I prefer wow, their customer server and techs have been better than Time Warner(no Spectrum), Insight, AT&T and everyone else I've used over the years.

So I called up, wanting to get on a new pricing plan.  Right now WOW is advertising $40 or $50 per month for 100Mbps internet depending on rather or not you sign up for a 2 year contract.

It took me about 40 minutes on the phone, and escalation to a supervisor to get the $40 for 100Mbps internet for 2 years.  This for a person who has been a customer with them since 2008.

You'd think sometime they would figure out that existing customers are cheaper than new customers.  You don't have to send techs to their house to install equipment.  You don't have to advertise to attract them.  Just super annoying.  

Finally I told the supervisor if I hung up without being on the new customer plan that I'd imediantly call Spectrum for a new install.  Which is what finally did it.

I swear if when this rate is up and they give me any of this production again then I actually will switch instead.

Sorry for a bit of the rant, just wanted to vent.

I guess the tip here is, if being polite and reasonable isn't working just resort to threats and see if that saves ya some money.  It did for me."

"I only spent $1,728.79 in 2022 for groceries, averaging around $144 a month, here‚Äôs some tips!",101t033,2023-08-13 23:29:16,302,4637," 

As the title suggest, I went through my budget and was surprised to see I really underspent on my groceries and wanted to share some things we did that might be helpful. This will be a long post but hopefully it helps someone, I only just learned how to cook this past year and used this sub to help me, so hopefully I‚Äôm able to pay it forward since some of the things I learned I haven‚Äôt seen mentioned here. Some things to get out of the way before the tips:

* This is strictly groceries, not eating out, or household maintenance no pots/pans, cleaning supplies, paper towels, coffee filters etc etc strictly food we consume
* I am the main decision maker when it comes to the kitchen, I pay for about %75 of groceries, my SO pitches in for smaller grocery runs (under $25) so the average is probably $200 a month, still way below the standard $300 for household of 2 adults
* We‚Äôre both 30, both work full time, no kids and combined make probably just over $130k in a fairly big city (MCOL) in the NE USA
* We share about %90 of the food we eat. Nothing exclusive to one another except a few random things ex. I drink almond milk, my SO drinks whole milk and some other small differences.
* We are NOT foodies, and we are NOT great cooks. This is my first year actually learning to cook. And it‚Äôs the reason we wanted to keep our grocery budget low, since we value everything else in our budget more than food, so as long as it‚Äôs nutritious and at least decent to eat, we‚Äôre happy :)

Last thing I wanted to share was some life events that impacted our budget, we relocated to this new city Dec 2021, so the first few months of the year I was still building out my pantry, which was an added expense. Then this past September I got a work from home position, so far my budget has not been influenced too much by it but only time will tell.

Okay time for tips:

\-**Most likely what you grew up eating, will be the cheapest thing for you to cook.** Whether you‚Äôre hispanic, asian, american, european‚Ä¶you have familiarity with the flavors and your pantry is probably already geared towards that pallet bringing the cost per meal way lower. For instance, I‚Äôm hispanic and I know off the top of my head 10 different rice recipes just because I grew up eating them, even if some of them I can‚Äôt cook just yet, I know how they‚Äôre suppose to taste and what‚Äôs involved in it. Give me a potato and I only know how to boil it. Maybe I‚Äôll add it to one of my hispanic dishes, but guess what? I‚Äôm still cooking rice to go with it. Speaking about cost per meal, I quickly realized how expensive it was to branch to diff food profiles, I wanted to learn how to cook more asian dishes and kinda had to stop haha, I had no room in my small kitchen for all the additional spices and noodles needed. I settled with some of the basic condiments (sesame oil, oyster sauce, soy sauce and kewpie lol) incase I want to venture off a bit, again a lot of these asian meals also involved rice. Leading me to my biggest point.

\-**Stick to one carb and run with it**, I rarely cook with potatoes, bread or pasta, my go-to carb is rice (no surprise). I know a lot of people complain about just eating rice and beans to be frugal. But take for instance, if you love potatoes, there‚Äôs literally hundreds of different ways to make potatoes interesting, seriously you really can‚Äôt get bored of something you *like* to eat. I think that‚Äôs the key. I do keep a box of spaghetti handy, and my bf buys bagels for his breakfast, and every once in a while I‚Äôll venture into other things but 80% of the time we‚Äôre eating rice and beans (with a salad and a protein).

\-**We buy the same protein every two weeks.** We buy chicken breast (more on that later), pork-chop (sometimes bone it sometimes not), ground beef (80/20) and shrimp. Every two weeks we run out of them, and we buy them again. If one gets too expensive, we buy an alternative (like ground turkey, or tilapia or chicken strips, whatever is available or cheapest) or we‚Äôll just go w/o one of the protein and maybe just do a veggie dish or stretch out whatever we already have. Eggs we buy about once a month, we only cook them on our off days.

\-**We almost never buy pre-made meals**, in the beginning I would buy frozen dinners for work and that‚Äôs included in this budget. But I would keep them at my work fridge, at home we just cook, eat leftovers or eat out before getting home. Now that I‚Äôm working from home, and have a bit more time I do want to learn how to make corn bread and banana bread since we do buy those for quick breakfast and those are easy enough to bake with fairly simple ingredients. I‚Äôm also learning how to cut a whole chicken so again I can make stock and learn how to cook more than just chicken breast (idk if I‚Äôll success but we‚Äôll see!).

\-**We always buy fruit and vegetables**, again we‚Äôre creatures of habit. We usually buy the same thing: romaine lettuce, tomatoes, baby carrots, and onion. And in the fruit department we rotate a bit more but we usually always have: apples, tangerine and blueberries (currently we also have kiwi and bananas, yum!). We use the veggies for salad with every meal but also for me to seasoning and we add the fruits to our oatmeal in the morning (yep we buy steel cut oats and just cook it stove top in the morning).

\-**We shop around a lot**. We do most of our groceries at Aldi (about %80). We also go to our local H-Mart and we just found a nearby Trader Joes near us, those are all our cheap options. We do a ShopRite or Walmart run every once in a while for some specific things. Lastly we do have a Costco membership where we do stock up on dry goods (for instance a 24pck of box almost milk, or 25pds of jasmine rice), but we mostly use Costco for clothes, appliances and household essentials, it does add up in savings even for just the two of us.

\-**I season in bulk and rotate!** So for instance, if have ground beef, I usually season the whole thing with my basic seasoning (salt, pepper, garlic, Goya), leave half out and freeze the other Half. I can make this weeks ground beef Spanish style with tomatoes, olives, cappers, peppers, cilantro etc and then, next week defrost the remainder and stir fry it with ginger, soy sauce, green onions and carrots. One base seasoning, two different approaches. Same with beans, I boil a pound of dry beans, season it all in a big pot, and divy up what I'll do with it and freeze the rest. Now I only cook about 2-3 time a week, If I‚Äôm tired, I know my beef is seasoned and can throw it in the pot, and I can just defrost some beans and put my rice cooker on and have dinner ready in 25min.

\-**Keep a notepad on the fridge with a running list for when things run out**, I know its common knowledge to always have a shopping list, but it really does work and help curve additional spending!

\-**If we can't eat it in a week, we freeze it.** Like just the most random things, you‚Äôd be surprise you can freeze. I for instance always freeze my cilantro, parsley and green peppers. Like I mentioned I usually freeze my rice and beans. My boyfriend always freezes hotdogs and bread. Also if there‚Äôs a can I didn‚Äôt finish off, like of tomatoes paste, I just chuck it in the freezer and next time I need it I run through hot water for a few minutes.

\-**Have an** **Emergency Meal ( a ""911"" like my mom used to call it)**. This is the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to lift a finger‚Äù meal or the ‚Äúour fridge is bare but we‚Äôre not off until tomorrow to grocery shop‚Äù meal. For us it's frozen french fries and frozen jamaican patties, its the only exception to pre-made meal we buy,  we really have gotten into a groove of cooking regularly so it, we only prepare it about 2-3 times a month.

Again, these are things I had to learn by trial and error, some may be obvious to the general public, but as someone who just learned to cook, it really wasn‚Äôt that obvious to me. Yes we probably had the money to be more liberal with our groceries, but 1. We had a lot of other obligations eating at our budget (no pun intended) so this was an easy place to free up some money. 2. We wanted to build habits that would help us in the future, like when we have kids and our budget will inevitable go up.

LPT: a bidet is cheaper than buying toilet paper(after a few months) specially a great thing to have when during inevitable toilet paper shortages that will happen.,fhno6j,2023-08-13 23:29:16,280,4584,"So In light of the recent toilet paper shortages I thought I would point out the bidet. It's an excellent way to do the job and it will drastically cut your paper usage. This can help save you money on paper, if you have a septic system it can help reduce the amount of physical waste(ie how often you will need to empty it), prevent cloggs. Also it's a lot cleaner if you think about it, if you got poop on your face would you just wipe it with a towel or wash it with water? Anywho these simple bidet installments can be found on Amazon or in local stores and can be relatively cheap(<50$) so good to get one now and be ready for the next inevitable paper shortages.

It will take a few times to get used to it, but they you will be very glad."
Anyone else thinking about cancelling Prime?,18sgekx,2023-08-13 23:29:16,1047,4583,"Long time Amazon Prime user. Kind of getting tired of their increasing greed and less services for higher cost. With Target and others offering increasingly convenient options like drive up and free shipping over certain dollar amounts, the main appeal of Prime is being chipped away. I used to use Amazon music as it was free and had all the music I would need, but they recently ruined that by not allowing replays, limiting skips, can‚Äôt play full albums (they mix in other songs) etc. Just ruined the experience unless of course you want to pay a fee. Then today, here comes ads in their streaming unless you want to pay another fee. Another issue is the concern over counterfeit goods and lack of control/supervision. I also had a weird incident happen recently in which I ordered a security camera and then the company called me directly twice to check my satisfaction, really to ask for reviews, and sent me a letter. 

All of this is adding up to me hitting the cancel button. I‚Äôm a capitalist at heart, but corporate greed is just getting out of control. Is $165,000,000,000 enough $$ for you Bezos."

Anyone else cancel their Amazon Prime and just start to buy from the actual websites or buy more local to save money?,nv6b14,2023-08-13 23:29:16,612,4535,"I canceled my Amazon Prime for two reasons 1. Everything became more expensive with worse quality. Idk if it's because the reviews are bad but a product would have a lot of good reviews and still not be good OR something would just be off like product opened when I got it or dented etc. 2. Even though they said 2 day shipping, it's no longer been a thing and I keep getting things 4 days, sometimes a week later and sometimes even longer. 

Once doing that I thought I would only save money from the monthly subscription but I've been saving money in other places as well. I go to the actual stores website and they almost always have deals to get things cheaper. There's no issues with the products either like when I buy on Amazon sometimes. They even send coupons in the mail and samples a lot of times from these store websites. The shipping never is that long. I think the longest has been around 5 days, and tbh that was the same Amazon has started to be. When it's bigger items or items that don't have a website store I just go in real life to places and it encourages me to try to find good deals along with quality. I've also been more willing to check out thrift stores. 

I noticed that when I shop on Amazon I was more willing to just throw something in the cart because it's ""only $10 extra"" for example. In real life I'm not as willing and I'm more careful.

I've saved a good amount already. People tell me Amazon is good for bulk items but idk what bulk items they are talking about since household items I've been able to get cheap in-store or again through the actual website. Dry food products maybe but I already spend very little on food? idk."

Then we went to our local roller skating rink. We have a ""membership"" there, so technically free. But basically we pay only $5 per person per YEAR to be able to skate every Friday evening. We all own our own skates, mostly bought from the thrift store.

At the rink, they held a pickle-eating contest for $1/ticket, so our kids participated in that. Our 5-year-old won a little hula hooping contest (no cost to enter). The prize was a $50 gift card for the arcade there. They spent the rest of the time enjoying that.

Anyways, just wanted to share what a fun, frugal night we had! It seems so rare now to find inexpensive meals and entertainment, so this felt like a win."

[And here are the before pics for those of you who were asking.](https://imgur.com/gallery/bQEqHub)


Modern couches are junk. The frames are literally made of cheap plywood and cardboard... yes cardboard. I needed a looooong couch to fill a space and everything of decent quality that fit my taste was really expensive, $2000-$3000. 

So I found a couch on Craigslist that I loved. It was custom built in 1954 and owned by the same woman ever since. It was the ‚Äúgood couch‚Äù and only sat on when she entertained in the formal dining room. The frame is solid oak and sturdy as hell. It has 8 way hand tied springs, which only the highest end sofas use these days. The upholstery was in good shape, but not my taste. The sofa was $200. 

I asked around until I found an older gentleman who worked out of his home shop. He‚Äôs retired but still does little jobs here and there. Several people told me he was one of the last true craftsmen in the field. He‚Äôs 87 and doesn‚Äôt need the money he told me, he just doesn‚Äôt have anything else to do and enjoys the work. His rates reflect that and are much more than fair. He recovered the entire couch and made new cushions for $490!

The fabric was maybe my best find. A huge fabric wholesaler happens to be headquartered in my town, and their outlet store is nearby. All the lines they discontinue are sent there. And it‚Äôs cheap. Really cheap. There‚Äôs no original price on the bolts, or info about the fabric, you just sort through all these unlabeled bolts and find something you like. This one was $4 a yard! And if you buy the entire bolt it‚Äôs 50% off. So I got all my material for $34. I was actually able to find a mill marking on the bolt when I got home and looked it up online. This upholstery fabric sold for $109 a yard new! It‚Äôs essentially a high end material used for swanky offices, casinos, etc. It‚Äôs made to last forever with high usage. 

I got my dream sofa for $724, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!!

This is one of the things I most commonly see folks confused about in r/FreeEBOOKS.  

[Here is an article about the release of works to the public domain](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/first-time-20-years-copyrighted-works-enter-public-domain-180971016/)

[Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is one of the main sources for free public domain ebooks.

Ebooks added this way will sync across devices like any ebook you get from Amazon. 



Please ask questions in the comments below if you are having trouble figuring this out - I plan to edit the instructions as I find where folks are confused. 


# 1 - Find your send to kindle email address

First you need to find your send to kindle email address. There are two ways to do this on your kindle or on the Amazon website, it‚Äôs way easier to find on your kindle.  


**Easy way: On your kindle: Click the gear icon -> All Settings -> Your Account -> your send to kindle email will be listed on this page.**


Harder way: Go to [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) then click Accounts & lists-> 

https://i.redd.it/up315qw13h721.jpg

 


under ‚ÄúDigital content and devices‚Äù click ‚ÄúContent and Devices‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/bfxxh6a53h721.png

 


Click ‚ÄúDevices‚Äù in the menu near the top ->

https://i.redd.it/94bpbnx63h721.png

 


click the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù next to you kindle in the device list you see on that page. Your send to kindle email will be listed in the small box that appears.  If you are on mobile you will see a gallery of images of kindles and app icons - click a kindle and you will see your send to kindle email address displayed below.  

https://i.redd.it/id3hyxh83h721.png

 


(Do not be alarmed if you see a shitload of devices listed, every time you download the kindle app on something it counts as a device - I have ‚Äúdevices‚Äù going back for many years of phones) 

Your send to kindle email address will be some variation on your name + @kindle.com



 

# 2 - Make sure the email you will be sending emails from to your send to kindle email address is whitelisted. If the email you send books from to your kindle is not white listed you will never get the books.

 

On [Amazon.com](http://amazon.com/) click ‚ÄúAccount & Lists‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/6uzd07wj3h721.jpg

 

under ‚ÄúDigital content and devices‚Äù click ‚ÄúContent and Devices‚Äù ->

https://i.redd.it/0sbp037l3h721.png




click ‚ÄúPreferences"" in the top bar of that page -> 

https://i.redd.it/33gegntn3h721.png

 

Click ‚ÄúPersonal Document Settings‚Äù -> 

https://i.redd.it/xv33a2eq3h721.png

 

find ‚ÄúApproved Personal Document E-mail List‚Äù on that page -> make sure the email you will be using to send books to your kindle is listed there.  

https://i.redd.it/cyzhtkor3h721.png




# 3 - Let‚Äôs send a book.  

 

Go to a book on [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?sort_order=downloads) \-> click either Kindle (with images) or Kindle (no images) to download the version of the ebook you would like to send to your kindle. 

https://i.redd.it/8r8zroxw3h721.png

 

Now open a new email message - fill in your send to kindle email address in the to field, then drag the book file into the email. Click send.  

Go to your kindle library and sync to make sure the book downloaded.  

I typically send ebooks to my kindle from my phone or iPad - you will follow the same process but often when you download a file your device will ask you what you want to do with the file - just choose email and send away.

Being frugal has helped me with dating!,b2js4y,2023-08-13 23:29:16,185,4255,"Howdy r/frugal, long-time lurker here. I've been frugal for years which has really helped me develop some new skills which has had an unexpected positive effect on my dating life. For the past several months I've been spending some time with a great girl, and recently realized that some of her favorite things about me are a result of me being frugal. For example:

* For years I was too poor to afford fancy meals, so I learned how to cook - and cook well. She LOVES it when I cook for her rather than take her out to a nice dinner. I have easily saved hundreds of dollars from this aspect of dating alone.
* Similarly, I grew up eating fresh, artisan bread from local bakeries my entire childhood, but adult me was too poor to buy bread at a bakery. So, I learned to bake. Whenever I bake, I double my yield and send her home with a loaf.
* I live in a city where there are TONS of free things to do. I follow lots of blogs, newsletters, instagram accounts, etc and curate these events for us to go to. She mentioned the other day how she loves that I have my finger on the pulse of the city. I thought to myself how funny that is because the reason I started going to these free events was because they were free.
* In the summertime, to save some money on groceries, I plant a small garden with herbs, fresh vegetables, and a few fruits. My passion for gardening and enthusiasm in sharing it with her has been very well received.
* In brainstorming adventures for us to go on, I've opted for hikes (free) or bike rides (cheap if you use bikeshare) rather than fancy, expensive experiences. She's new to outdoor activities, but has really loved these dates.

Anywho, take it from me - I did not expect the benefits of frugality to spill over into my dating life. But here we are, and I am so much better for it! Good luck to all and happy fruging.

Edit: Wow! Gold! On a post about being frugal... ah the irony, but thanks nonetheless! What does this stuff do anyway? "

"WARNING: Sears' current promo of ""$7.00 off $70.00+ Purchase"" will sneak the charge back in at the end of the transaction.",4iw3qu,2023-08-13 23:29:16,468,4252,"Hello all, 

I bought a mattress online from Sears today.  

After I made the purchase, I received the receipt in the mail, and as always looked it over to make sure everything looked all right. 

Here is an album showing the receipt emailed to me from Sears and an explanation of how they overcharged me, along with a screenshot of the problematic promo:  http://imgur.com/a/cDrxi

I just spent over an hour on the phone with customer service, spoke with a regular representative who told me Sears would only add $7.00 in points back to my ""Save Your Way Account"" and not back to my credit card.  I seldom shop at Sears, so I didn't want that.  I told her I could just cancel the whole order and put it through again to see if the new promo worked the second time, but she told me since I paid with gift cards, that it would take up to 3 business days to process the balance back on my gift cards to try again.  And there was no guarentee that it would work the second time. 

Then I spoke to a supervisor to see if there was anything that could be done, and to give him a heads up that their website promo is being screwy and they should probably alert IT (just my advice).  At first he didn't believe me that there was a promo going on for $7 off a Purchase of $70+.  Then once I had him look at the actual company website to see I didn't make up the promo, he kept trying to get me to just accept the points instead of a return to my credit card.  Then he tried to tell me that since I used gift cards, my price fell below the $70+ restriction on the promo, which I could tell he was a rule he made up on the spot (says no where on the promo, and gift cards are to be treated as cash).  Finally he ended up giving me an email address to their ""back office"" to get rid of me when I wouldn't relent that the $7.00 store credit was not acceptable.  I wrote a lengthy email, sent it, and it bounced back to me that saying, ""WHOOPS!  You replied to an unmonitored email address.""  Great. 

Finally I spoke with a very kind customer service rep online who told me that the rude supervisor apparently sent in a request for a $7.00 credit back to my *credit card* to their billing department, and I will find out in about 3-5 business days if it's granted to me.   

I know this seems like a big fuss to make over $7.00, but I knew if anyone would understand why I fought for it, it would be the people of /r/Frugal.  Pretty sure this is the sort of thing that could evolve into a class action law suit if it happens to enough people.  Oh well.  Guess I'll see in a few days if I get my money back or not.  

TL;DR:  $7 off promo is listed on my receipt, but my final payment does not reflect that discount.  Called customer service, spoke with one helpless person, one rude supervisor, and one nice guy on chat and I *might* get my money back if ""billing approves it."" 


Edit:  I received my receipt via E-mail.  Electronic mail.  Not snail mail haha.  Thanks for all the responses everyone!  FYI, I have not tweeted at Sears or gone to their Facebook yet.  I'll wait to see if they approve or deny the request that the Supervisor submitted before I jump in for a good old fashioned public shaming.

EDIT 2:  So far I've had two people from Sears reach out to me via PM.  I called and spoke with one of them today, and it sounds like he's been able to get the $7.00 returned to my credit card.  He told me it should show up in 3-5 business days, so I'll be sure to post an update for anyone who'd be interested to let you know if it comes through or not.  "

I have saved myself from many pointless purchases by looking at my paycheck differently,6m8db1,2023-08-13 23:29:16,378,4177,"One day I was curious about how much money I take home an hour after deductions.

Once I figured it was roughly 10 dollars an hour and I get paid roughly 390 a week, I started looking at past purchases on my debit card.

 I bought an energy drink for 3.90 and realized that 1% of my paycheck was gone at one break at work.

40 dollars of take out and 10% of my paycheck is gone.

It made me much more hesitant to spend my money on trivial things because the percentage system was easier for me to grasp the impact it had on my bank account.

I‚Äôm a tutor and I regularly use Khan Academy videos on YouTube in order to brush up on a subject before meeting with one of my students. Parents can easily use this in the same way and maybe even avoid having to pay an expensive tutor.


Plus, there are courses you can work through on the website so if your kid is out of homework but still needs practice, you can use these. Also a great idea for during the summer in order to ensure your kid doesn‚Äôt forget everything.


Finally, teachers are well aware of this resource so if your kid is struggling then you can just email them and say something like, ‚Äúcan you point me to a Khan Academy class which teaches how to do this so I can work with my kid at home?‚Äù The teacher will likely be able to give you something right away."

YOUR LABOUR IS NOT WORTHLESS,fymsqe,2023-08-13 23:29:16,361,4097,"something that really bugs me about some frugal people, is that they don't value their labor at all. like yes making your own everything will save you money, but how much time is it going to cost? and how much value could you get out of that time doing other things?

sure lots of people so their own clothes and grow their own veggies because they enjoy doing that kind of thing and that's awesome. they get emotional value out of the hobby, and dollar value out of the savings.

but how many people here spend a lot of time doing things they don't enjoy trying to spare themselves a small amount of money? 

imagine that you're paying yourself to do these jobs. every minute you spend doing some chore is a minute you could be spending creating value or doing the things you enjoy. 

being frugal isn't about maximizing dollars, it's about maximizing value, and time is the most valuable thing any person has."

I compared them on Walmart's website and Ninja's official website, and the one on Walmart is 100 watts less. 

I've heard of companies making different versions of the same product, one of which is made of cheaper materials so they can sell it at Walmart to meet their demands. Is this one case of it happening?

I was a coffee barista for 4 years; here are our recipes for our best selling iced drinks that you can make for cheaper at home!,pgzej7,2023-08-13 23:29:16,154,4024,"Former coffee barista here! There was a post recently on here where I left a comment about how to make some specialty drinks that people enjoyed when I was a barista, so I figured I‚Äôd make my own post so more people could find it.

As a preface since this is r/frugal and I‚Äôm sure there are other current/former barista‚Äôs on here‚Äîtake my advice/ingredient recs with a grain of salt! I didn‚Äôt work at Starbucks (I worked at a small independent cafe here in Westchester NY) and every cafe uses different ingredients and has different ratios for their recipes. So if you‚Äôve found that a recipe I‚Äôm sharing sounds too sweet or you don‚Äôt want to spend x for a certain brand because you have your own preferred brand then hey, feel free to experiment/substitute with your favorites! Nothing is set in stone and at best these are just base recipes till you figure out what ratio and brands work for you. And if you think to yourself ‚Äúwell I‚Äôm not spending $30+ for all that!‚Äù Then clearly you don‚Äôt drink these enough to hurt your wallet‚Äîwhich, good for you.

So, let‚Äôs get started!

**Chocolate sauce:**

A tip I learned for mocha drinks (even without a fancy machine) is to either add a splash of hot coffee to the bottom of your cup after decorating the sides with chocolate, so it‚Äôll melt and you don‚Äôt get a straw full of chocolate as your first sip and you still have the pretty decoration. The reason I started doing this (I wasn‚Äôt trained about that) was because I noticed customers complaining about one of my coworkers leaving a huge pool of chocolate at the bottom of the cup, so from then on I started melting it with some coffee and I suddenly had customers wanting me specifically to make their drinks‚Äîit‚Äôs the little things that make a difference, I‚Äôm telling ya! Same can be applied for caramel sauce and honey--honey in coffee is sinfully delicious.

If you‚Äôre using cold brew and don‚Äôt have hot coffee ready then a splash of hot water works just as well and won‚Äôt mess up the flavor.

**Syrups/sauces:**

HomeGoods/Marshalls has fantastic coffee syrups and is easily available to the public--Amazon carries these brands as well but I've found that they're  cheaper at HomeGoods/Marshalls. The best brands for flavoring coffees are either the Torani or Monin syrups; that‚Äôs what my job used and customers loved them and I even go out of my way to see what brands small coffee shops use and so far it‚Äôs been these two so you know they‚Äôre good. I have also seen both the Torani chocolate and caramel sauce there and for the price they are worth the buy. Unfortunately when you buy them from the store they don't come with a pump, so if you have a shot glass then just add a shot at a time to your drink till you're content with the flavor. If you don't have a shot glass them go a tablespoon at a time.

If you‚Äôre looking to cut down on sugar (or can't have) but still enjoy flavored drinks then the Torani sugar free vanilla (which is what I usually see at HomeGoods) is VERY sweet (tastes sweeter than the normal one actually) so I usually just add a pump or even just half a pump to my coffee and it‚Äôs delicious. If you‚Äôre not used to sugar free syrups you‚Äôll definitely taste a difference but trust me when I say that if you really wanna cut out your sugar intake (and are fine with fake sugar) then just keep trying to drink it and after maybe a week your palette changes and you‚Äôll find it yummyü§§

For anyone doubting my last comment: I used to take my coffee as super light and sweet back when I was in college; basically sugar in a cup and for the life of me I couldn‚Äôt stand the taste of anything sugar free. Then I realized I should stop adding sugar and slowly phased out the amount of sugar I was using until I got to the point where I was just drinking my coffee with some oat milk. Wasn‚Äôt super yummy but it got the job done and I wasn‚Äôt making a face when drinking it anymore! Whenever I want to actually enjoy the taste is when I‚Äôll add a half pump of sugar free vanilla syrup to my cup.

The flavors we had of the syrups were as followed for our hot or iced coffees/lattes (starting from the left was the most popular, to the least popular with customers):

Vanilla

Pistachio (Monin brand‚Äîthe syrup is green and I‚Äôm not joking when I say we had times where we couldn‚Äôt meet demand because we kept running out)

Caramel

Sugar free vanilla

Hazelnut

Pumpkin spice (not the worst one or anything but people tended to think we didn't carry pumpkin spice year round so they didn't ask for it outside of Autumn. This is honestly best in the chai mixes anyway--not on its own.)

And for iced teas:

Mango (Torani brand)

Peach (Monin brand)

Sugar free raspberry (Monin)

**Chai/Pumpkin spice lattes:**

We used Big Train brand chai latte mix (find it on Amazon‚Äî it‚Äôs a bag or can with a dark purple label).

If you don‚Äôt have a steamer wand then add 2-3 scoops to a small pan with your choice of milk with 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup. Mix well and heat up till desired temperature. If doing iced then add 3 scoops and 2 pumps of vanilla syrup. It‚Äôs a sweet mix on its own, but with some experimenting you‚Äôll find your ratio of sweetness when adding the syrups.

If you want a pumpkin spice flavored drink then buy a bottle of Torani pumpkin spice syrup and add 1 pump of vanilla and 2 pumps of pumpkin spice instead (and a single or double shot of espresso‚Äîpumpkin spice is traditionally with espresso but if you just want something similar to the chai/don't want espresso then feel free to omit the espresso). Top it off with some cinnamon‚Äîyum!

Chai lattes were (and still currently are) the biggest seller at that cafe. You can also try using Trader Joe‚Äôs brand chai latte mix; this brand mix is slightly less sweet but is spicier (as in flavor because of the spices used‚Äînot spicy as in hot. The flavor is exactly what you‚Äôll think of when you think Autumn) which can really be yummy as well. One of my coworkers that doesn‚Äôt like how sweet the Big Train brand is said that she finds the Trader Joe‚Äôs brand to be of better quality. Big Train Chai mix is not authentic chai but it does taste good, which I know is what a lot of people care most about.

If you want some coffee in your chai then feel free to make it a dirty chai by adding a shot or two of espresso into it.

**Chocolate/Strawberry milk:**

Whenever we had kids (or even some adults) we'd get asked for chocolate milk. It wasn't on our menu but I made it for them anyway. Just take your desired amount of milk and add it to a small pan with chocolate sauce and 1-3 pumps of vanilla. Chocolate milk is served cold, so just barely heat up the milk enough to melt the chocolate and then pour it into your cup. I usually will add 1-2 ice cubes to keep the milk cold for the kids.

We had a strawberry puree for one of our pastries and one day I experimented to see if I could make strawberry milk and it worked and it's downright sinful. You can either buy your own strawberry puree or make your own by just adding some sugar to some mashed up strawberries and cooking them on the stovetop till the strawberries break down. Once cooled you can store in a jar. Look up any video for making jams and it's about the same process I believe, just less cooking time since the longer you cook it for, the thicker it becomes. Purees are looser than jams.

Once you have your puree, do the same steps as you would for the chocolate milk (the vanilla syrup is what really brings the flavor together).

**Ice cubes:**

If you love iced coffee during the summer then coffee ice cubes are great! We only made a few trays because the customers that knew we had them would take advantage and we couldn‚Äôt meet the demand for them since we already had a regular ice machine. Coffee ice cubes really help keep your drink from getting watered down. Espresso ice cubes work great as well either for your iced coffee or for an iced latte. Don‚Äôt bother adding milks or flavorings to the cubes; just put black coffee or just pure espresso into an ice cube tray and freeze them. We used large silicone ice cube molds for the largest cup (it never fit into the cup so I would just run some hot water on the cube to get it to the right size)‚Ä¶was a bit more convenient to do during a rush then to just grab a glove and hope I get a bunch of smaller cubes into the cup without dropping anything. Plus the bigger cubes tend to last until you finish your drink and still be plenty left over if you wanted a refill. If making regular sized cubes is better for you then go right ahead.

**Hot chocolate:**

For a really yummy hot chocolate I recommend the Ghirardelli hot chocolate mix. We kind of used whatever brand we could get but our customers went crazy for the Ghirardelli mix specifically so we tended to stick with that one.

Add a drizzle of chocolate sauce to your pan with your desired amount of milk and for 24oz add 3 scoops (2 scoops for anything smaller) and 1-2 pumps of vanilla syrup OR 1 pump of vanilla and 1-2 pumps of peppermint syrup for a peppermint hot chocolate. Heat to your desired temperature, drizzle a bit of chocolate into your cup and top off the drink with some whipped cream and unsweetened cocoa powder. If you‚Äôd like a dirty hot chocolate (which are crazy delicious) then add a shot of espresso to your cup. The flavor from the espresso pairs very well with chocolate.

I have tried the Ghirardelli white chocolate mix and it was alright‚Äîdidn‚Äôt taste bad or anything but I wasn‚Äôt personally crazy about it, but then again I‚Äôm not super crazy about white chocolate in general but some people are. If you prefer white chocolate then use the same recipe for the hot chocolate mix but just replace the chocolate sauce with white chocolate sauce. Or you can make it black & white by using chocolate sauce with the white chocolate mix (that was my favorite thing to do).

I actually did once mix the white chocolate mix and hot chocolate mix together so the white chocolate mix wouldn‚Äôt go to waste‚Äîand it was pretty good!

**Iced tea:**

When it comes to steeping teas you‚Äôd be surprised by how accurate tea guides are‚Äîthe ones that tell you how long to steep certain types. We used to have a huge tea bag that we would just drop in a huge container of hot water and customers hated it‚Äîtoo bitter/didn‚Äôt taste yummy. Then my coworker looked up what temperature the water for black tea should be and how long it should be steeped for and customers started loving the flavor after that.

If you enjoy fresh iced teas then I‚Äôve found that mixing different tea bags can make some really refreshing teas‚ÄîI actually got the idea from one of our regulars. We usually used the Bigelow brand or Steep brand tea bags.

Take 1 bag of mint and 1 bag of green tea. Once it‚Äôs steeping add in a piece of yellow lemon and your desired amount of honey or agave. We usually would put the steaming pitcher (or cup) in an ice bath and by the time the mixture cooled (after mixing it every now and then to speed up the cooling process) then it was perfect and less likely to get bitter from over steeping. You can either take the bags out or keep them in your cup and just add your desired amount of ice (you get a stronger flavor this way and with the honey you‚Äôre less likely for the bags to make the tea bitter). This iced tea is perfect during a hot summer day‚Äîthe mint is mellowed out by the grassiness of the green tea and the honey really bring outs the flavor. So you get the coolness of the mint and the sweetness from the honey.

Another refreshing combination is 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of green (specifically the Steep brand lemon ginger bags‚Äîmy absolute favorite, and it was a huge favorite for customers as well‚Äîhot or cold) with some honey and lemon. Or even 1 bag of lemon ginger with 1 bag of mint with honey and lemon.

**\*Please make sure that either both teas are caffeine free or just one of them has caffeine. If both have caffeine then it'll be too much caffeine for your body to handle and your heart will race like crazy and make you feel like you're having a panic attack--ask me how I know...**

&#x200B;

**London fog:**

Take two bags of earl grey tea and add 2-3 pumps of vanilla syrup. After adding your desired amount of hot water, add the cup to an ice bath and stir till cooled down. Add the tea mixture to a cup of ice and add a splash of your choice of milk. Take a taste and if not sweet enough then just add more vanilla syrup. Very simple but so yummy. If making it hot then top it off with some steamed milk.

Our store unfortunately didn‚Äôt have a blender so I don‚Äôt have any frappe recipes, sorry! I truly hope this helps a few of you out :)

Enjoy, and don‚Äôt be afraid to lightly experiment with different flavor/brand combinations!"

When your main source of income is Social Security you pinch every penny, quarantine every quarter, nab every nickel you can.  I went to Kroger yesterday because I was out of pie crusts and Aldi stopped selling the boxes of them. 

I punched in my Kroger number and nothing happened.  Oh it recognized me but the list of discounts applied never appeared.  I asked the clerk and she said, ""Kroger ended the Senior Discount on 9/15 (It was September 12th but oh well) because they found out too many young people were using the discount.  

I get that.  You have a problem, you need to fix it.  But fire the employees who were giving it to their friends and family.  Tighten up the sign-up so an ID has to be produced and if need be shown at the register.  But ending the program?  That's the nuclear option.  That is punishing your customers for your problem.  

I will probably still go to Kroger for some things but from now on I will be calculating if the trip to Kroger is worth going an extra mile.  Sprouts is closer, both Aldi stores are closer.  Come on Kroger, fix the problem.

I came across this book years ago because the death of Thomas Stanley from a car crash was in the news. What really struck me was the outpouring of gratitude from millions of people who read his co-authored book. 

This book really surprised me when I read it. This book correctly identifies millionaires as being cheapskates, not the overspending stereotypes we are used to hearing about. It talks about how high income earners can go broke by overspending, and how those with modest incomes can achieve millionaire status by being frugal.

Don't let ur frugality ruin friendship,8zbeyc,2023-08-13 23:29:16,603,3782,"I was so close to ruining my friendship today by being way too cheap. I haven't seen this friend of mine for close to a year and I was keep suggesting cheap fast food place for dinner. My friend eventually got a bit pissed at me saying ""Don't be too cheap on friendship"".

In hindsight, I was wrong. I kept pestering him to find the cheapest place possible when I could have spend a little more to have a quality time.

Just want to let u know guys that friendship is worth more than saving 5dollars

I apologized at the end, so I think everything is cool."

What an incredible surprise when Amazon boxes showed up on our porch this weekend!  Bonus teen has been spending most days at our home lately and I can see the anxiety and stress levels come down slowly.  We are working on building trust and teaching skills for all of the kids.

I woke up this morning to find a bunch of messages, because the post had been added to the bestofredditorupdates.  I am so thankful for all of you supporting our effort to be a safe place in a scary world for this teenager.



Original post: A few months ago, I asked for frugal meal ideas to help us stretch our family's budget to incorporate an extra teenager.  You all were amazing in not only giving ideas but many of you sent items from a wish list that helped us meet immediate needs.  We were able to make sure the teen had the toiletry items, clothing that fit and were weather appropriate and have simple meals and snacks available.

In the past few months, our bonus teen has been spending a lot of time at our house with our teens and they all have been learning simple life skills like doing their own laundry, budgeting, and cooking.  The newest request from all of our teens is to learn baking.  I have seen the anxiety lessen throughout the months.

I wanted to update and let you all know what an important role you have played in this young teenager's life, as well as my family.  Thank you for opening your hearts and helping.  We hope to be able to stay in this teenager's life for years to come and to continue to provide support, in whatever they need.

Editing to answer questions asked in messages:

1. The snacks and meals lasted for more than 3 months, plus we still have a few things left.
2. The toiletry items have helped a lot in our bonus teen‚Äôs self-confidence.
3. I am working on my relationship with teen‚Äôs family, but there are still a few obstacles in the way.

Save TONS of money when selling/buying a home (advice from a former real estate agent).,41p707,2023-08-13 23:29:16,440,3599,"*Edit: This got way bigger than I thought it would and I'm worried that people are going to put a lot of stock in what I wrote, so if you're consulting this at some point in the future as an official guide to how to buy real estate from an industry veteran, I feel I should mention that I do not consider myself anything close to a real estate expert. The point of this post is really not to tell you the best way to buy or sell a home. What I intended to do was show people that the internet has changed buying and selling real estate and the old model deserves some scrutiny. It's up to you to decide what's right for you and to research your options because there are now more options than ever for buying/selling. Read the comments, read the replies, read everything you can about real estate and talk to other people you trust. Buying and selling a home is a HUGE undertaking. Don't just mindlessly hire an agent because you think that the fact that they have a license makes them valuable. It doesn't. Equally important, don't mindlessly follow my advice below thinking that you'll definitely save money. You might not. There is risk in everything. Just be sure that whatever you choose, you take control. Don't let agents bully you or scare you into thinking they are the only option. Also, I just had an interesting thought. If you're a curious type and have some spare time. You could take the same real estate courses that agents take from your local association for around $500 or so. Even if you get an agent, it could be money and time worth spending. Plus the classes are interesting if you like that sort of thing!*

I started writing some of these points in a different thread and realized that many of you frugal folks might appreciate some tips to save THOUSANDS of dollars when selling or buying a home. I used to sell real estate before the bubble burst and I went broke but I did it just long enough to realize the traditional real estate agent model is set up in a way that really doesn't always benefit consumers. I honestly thought that the old school model of an agent listing a home for 6% commission would completely shift when the internet started becoming more sophisticated in that industry. While that has happened to some degree, the Realtor's association is very strong and I think most people are still unaware that you don't have to hire someone at 6% commission to sell your home and you don't really need to hire a buyer's agent either. In fact, the benefits of hiring one are usually negligible at best and actually often worse than the alternative. In almost all cases there are specialists (attorneys, photographers, appraisers, inspectors etc.) that you can hire who will do a better job for way less money. And while it may seem as though managing all of that by yourself might be difficult or time consuming I would argue that with the tools available to us through the internet it's comparable to hiring an agent on both counts. As with most things, there are plenty of exceptions where my advice doesn't apply but I think this will be helpful for many people buying/selling a home (even seasoned veterans of home sales and purchases) to understand that there are alternatives besides the old model. Since every circumstance is different, I encourage you to meet with agents and see what they have to offer to determine what's right for you but this should help you with some behind-the-scenes context that agents aren‚Äôt likely to mention. With no further ado, I give you my guide to buying and selling a house on the cheap.

Selling your home: 

**Why you think you need a seller's agent** - If you're selling your house, you may think the only way to do it is to hire an agent. Maybe you believe the process is too complicated for you or you think that the real estate agent has some sort of magical house-selling power or they can bring a list of buyers that will pay top dollar for your property. You may even think that they can take the pain away from what is typically a very painful process.

**Why you don't** - Unless you have a lot of varied skills and *recent* experience with buying and selling homes already, you will need help. But the real question is whether a seller's agent is worth 5%-6% of your home's value and are there cheaper/better alternatives. As a reminder, 6% comes out to $12,000 on a $200,000 home! Here are some things an agent can actually do for you to earn that 6% commission. Provide advice on pricing and home improvements to get your house ready for sale. Take pictures, write copy and enter all the other relevant data into the local MLS service (basically, fill out a form online). Help lead negotiations when you have a deal on the table. Of all of those benefits, the most important is getting your property listed on the MLS. This is the service that companies like Trulia and Zillow use to populate their websites and is the service that other realtors use as the main database to find properties to show their clients. If you're not on the MLS, you're basically not really for sale. This is something that realtors rely on to keep normal people like us coming to them. But there is a solution to that problem (included in the bullets below). Other than the MLS thing, though, the internet renders most of the realtor‚Äôs benefits obsolete. So here‚Äôs how to get the above benefits without spending $12,000:

* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) ‚Äì There is no true science to pricing a home. Realtors and appraisers will argue that point but real estate is so much more nuanced than a scoring spreadsheet will tell you. Ultimately, it comes down to just knowing your market. Use sites like Trulia to see current properties on the market to evaluate your competition. Then look at properties similar to yours that have sold within the last 3-6 months or so to get an idea of a realistic final selling price. Assuming you‚Äôre not delusional and you know your neighborhood, you will get pretty close. Even when people hire agents, the agent often just lists for whatever the seller wants anyway. If you so desire, you can have a professional appraisal done on your property for less than $400, though many agents will offer a free ‚Äúhome valuation‚Äù as part of their marketing efforts hoping that you will ultimately list with them. If you‚Äôre comfortable having them do this with no intension of hiring them, that‚Äôs kind of up to your personal moral code, but it is an option. Many agents will do this for you even if you explicitly tell them you are going to try to sell on your own because they know you may call them if you decide to list with an agent eventually.
* Home improvement advice (Max value; $0.00) - You could read countless articles on how to prepare a home for sale and follow their advice, which will probably be all you need. An agent will not actually help you prep your house for sale, that‚Äôs still on you, so the value here is minimal if anything at all. The most important things in my opinion are to DECLUTTER EVERYTHING and make sure the place is clean. Seriously, before you decide to put $5,000 into a bathroom or landscaping or whatever before you sell your place, consider renting a temporary storage unit and putting everything you don‚Äôt absolutely need in there. I‚Äôm talking couches, big furniture, stuff jammed in closets. Get rid of it all. 
* Marketing (Max value; $200) ‚Äì You will need to have pictures and marketing copy to put your property on the MLS and other real estate websites. Your biggest cost here will be photography. You can find local photographers who focus on real estate who will charge you a completely reasonable rate. Photos are important, so I really don‚Äôt recommend doing this on your own unless you really know what you‚Äôre doing. Many agents even take photos of their properties themselves and they are terrible. As for copy, never in the history of real estate has excellent copy sold a home. You don‚Äôt need to be Keats with your copy. Just the facts. Take a look at a few examples of other descriptions that you like on other homes and just use that same structure for your home. There are other details you‚Äôll need like number of beds/bathrooms etc. but you will already know that and the agent doesn‚Äôt add any value there. You may have some additional investment in something like a $10 ‚ÄúFor Sale‚Äù sign or maybe something else but the days of agents incurring marketing costs to list your property in the newspaper are long gone yet the commission rate remains the same.
* Listing on the MLS (Max value; $500) ‚Äì This is one area you will need to hire a realtor for but you do not need to pay them 6% or sign a long-term contract with anyone. Look for a local agent or agency who offer flat fee service. For around $500, they will list your property on the local MLS. Once it‚Äôs listed there, it will get picked up by all of the major real estate websites and added to their databases automatically. For this, it is important to find a local realtor rather than a faceless online entity because if you need to make changes to your listing for any reason, you will need a human being to be responsive to your needs.
* Paperwork (Max value; $0-$1,000?) ‚Äì Okay, so lots of flat-fee agents will also offer an option to buy standard real estate documents for your state. That‚Äôs what you want. I don‚Äôt recommend buying them online or trying to cobble together your own homemade contract because you can‚Äôt be sure it‚Äôs any good. Each state is different and the standard contracts are frequently updated. I recommend you ask your flat-fee agent for any paperwork you will need to list and sell your house. Agencies that specialize in flat-fee service will likely be able to explain each document to you as well to help you with that ‚ÄúI have no idea what I‚Äôm looking at‚Äù anxiety. Some of the forms can be intimidating but if you take your time with them and familiarize yourself with them before you have to fill them out, it‚Äôs really not bad at all. Even if you‚Äôre very worried about screwing this part up, you can just hire a real estate attorney to review your documents to make sure they‚Äôre in line with what you want. It will be expensive, maybe up to $500/hour, but it will still save you money overall. Plus, an attorney is almost always better than an agent at getting these documents right.
So why is the commission so high? At one point, selling a house was a lot more work. Running newspaper ads, marketing houses, attracting buyers was kinda difficult. But the fact is that even back then, only a small portion of that commission ever went to the seller‚Äôs agent him/herself. They split any commission they receive with a buyer‚Äôs agent (50%) and their broker (usually 50% depending on the agent‚Äôs deal with their broker) and they incurred costs along the way. Nowadays, they do not incur similar costs to market your property but the overhead of maintaining a brokerage still exists. Someone needs to cover the cost to keep the place going which includes high costs for attorney retainers and errors & omissions insurance for the agents in case they make a mistake. Since you are not a licensed professional, you do not need E&O insurance and if you want to consult an attorney, you can do so hourly instead of on a retainer.
* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $2,100. Assuming that you are still offering 3% to a buyer's agent, your total max cost would be $8,100 on a $200,000 home. That's a savings of $3,900 over the standard 6% commission model but I honestly think most people will be able to do this for closer to $1,500-$1,700 though.

Buying a home:

**Why you think you need a buyer‚Äôs agent:** - You may want a buyer‚Äôs agent because you think they are free. After all, the seller‚Äôs agent will split his/her commission with your agent, so it‚Äôs no money out of your pocket. Or maybe you feel like you need someone to help you find the perfect home, or get you financing or maybe you just want someone to help you through the process. It can be nerve racking!

**Why you don‚Äôt:** - Buyer‚Äôs agents are not free. Someone has to pay them and the cost always comes from somewhere. If there is no seller‚Äôs agent, then you will likely be responsible for paying your agent out of your own pocket (read your agreement!!) If there is a seller‚Äôs agent, then they will split their commission with the buyer‚Äôs agent. However if there‚Äôs a seller‚Äôs agent and no buyer‚Äôs agent, the seller‚Äôs agent will often be willing reduce their commission by 50% and put that toward the home price. So if the seller is offering their agent 6% on a $200,000 house ($12,000), they can ask their agent to reduce the commission to 3% since they won‚Äôt have to split it with a buyer‚Äôs agent. Then, the seller can reduce their sale price of the home by $6,000 without affecting their out-of-pocket costs and the seller‚Äôs agent still gets the 3% they would have gotten if they split it with your buyer‚Äôs agent. Basically, you just saved $6,000 plus 30 years of interest on that money. The key here is to negotiate the price to as low as the seller will go, then ask for the agent to cut the commission. Otherwise, you can‚Äôt be sure you‚Äôre getting the bottom price. So if you want to buy a house without an agent, here‚Äôs how to get (most of) the benefits without spending $6,000:

* Find the perfect home (Max value; $0) ‚Äì Trulia, Zillow, Realtor.com, whatever. Your agent doesn‚Äôt have magical powers. You can find your own property just as easily and you run less of a risk of missing one that you want. You can set up alerts, too. In this case the agent is really only a middleman slowing down the process.
* Coordinate showings (Max value; $500) ‚Äì This is actually a pain in the butt if you‚Äôre the type to look at a ton of houses but if you‚Äôre smart about it, you can schedule multiple showings on the same day to keep things fairly easy. Like book yourself to look at three houses on Saturday instead of looking at them one at a time. It shouldn‚Äôt take too long but if saving yourself a few phone calls to set up showings is worth $6,000 to you, then by all means hire an agent. Or, if you really like the frugal lifestyle while also living like a baller you could just hire a personal assistant online to handle that for you for probably around $30/hour or less. You could set up a TON of showings for well under $500.
* Neighborhood awareness ($? - You decide value) ‚Äì If you‚Äôre moving across the country or otherwise unfamiliar with your new town, an agent may be worth the money for peace of mind but you'll need to decide if that's worth $6,000 to you. With the internet, a few hours of research will show you everything you might want to know. Determine what is important to you when finding a location and there's virtually nothing the agent can tell you that the internet won't tell you. Commute times, school districts, tax rates. All of that stuff is online.
* Financial advice ($0) ‚Äì Working with a mortgage broker (A broker is someone who works with multiple banks) or directly with a reputable bank will often provide you better advice than an agent. Most agents will just tell you to talk to the lender anyway. Tell them what you want to do with your home purchase and they will work it out with you.
* Pricing advice (Max value; $400) ‚Äì See explanation above. Also, you have the added benefit here if you are getting a mortgage that the bank will require an appraisal before you can get financed. In other words, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to overpay for the home.
* Answering questions/consulting ($1,000-? - You decide value) ‚Äì Of all the reasons to have a buyer‚Äôs agent, I think this is the best one. If you haven‚Äôt purchased a home before, you will probably have a ton of questions and there is some real benefit to having someone on call that you trust to help you through your anxieties. If you don‚Äôt have a friend or family member to do this with you and the prospect of buying a house is overwhelming to you, an agent may be worth the money just to ease your fears. That being said, if you buy a house from a seller with an agent who doesn‚Äôt suck, that agent will be able to walk you through your issues too. There are even a lot of agents who would be happy to answer some of your simpler questions even though they won't get paid. Agents are generally a nice bunch of people who legitimately want to help. The only thing is you‚Äôll be on your own until you decide to put an offer in on a property but that‚Äôs when you‚Äôll really need help. Up to that point, it‚Äôs just arranging showings for the most part. Remember, the seller‚Äôs agent wants the process to go as smoothly as you do. They will help you get your financing in order and help you work though all of the issues and questions you may have as you go along. But remember, the sellers agent really want you to buy that particular house so be sure to get a home inspection before you finalize your sale, even if you're buying a brand new house! It generally costs around $300 or so and it's always money well spent. Even if you hire an agent, though, you will still pay for this out of pocket, so you won't save any money here by having an agent. Also, you will want to buy standard home sale contracts for your state if the seller doesn't already have them and if you want to be totally sure your deal is air-tight, you can hire an attorney to review the contract before you submit it to the seller, though I believe that wouldn't be necessary unless there is no seller's agent at all.
* **Total max value of agent's services if you hire individual professionals**: $1,900. 

Okay, I spent way too much time writing that and I‚Äôm sure there are things I‚Äôm leaving out and things I should have thought through better and other general errors, but I believe this would be a good start for anyone looking to save money buying or selling a home.

*Edit: Okay, this got a lot bigger than I expected but I got tons of feedback and tried to reply to as many of the comments as I could. I encourage you to read through them for varying perspectives. First, it seems that many Realtors want me to clarify that there's a difference between excellent agents and ""bad"" ones. I agree that an excellent agent can be worth the money and may even pay for themselves in some situations but you have to decide what that's worth to you. I would also point out that I was a mediocre agent, not bad, but not great either. I would classify maybe 5% of agents as excellent. After that, there is a huge dropoff in quality (just my opinion from what I saw in my market) to people like me. What I'm telling you is that I believe that the work I did as a mediocre agent could be done by almost anybody else on their own with just a little bit of effort. When it comes to the value proposition, others have mentioned that some agents will list a property for a 4% commission. In that case, just calculate your savings from selling by yourself using similar math that I used above and decide if you think they're worth it. That said, it's been my experience that agents willing to cut their commissions to get listings aren't often the best in the area, so that might be a consideration too.*

*As a final note, many people mentioned the company Redfin, which I hadn't heard of before but it seems pretty great on the surface. I have no experience with them, but it might be worth exploring for you.*"

How I reduced my utilities by almost 80% - Attempt #2,buun1h,2023-08-13 23:29:16,301,3597,"Attempt #2 in writing this hopefully it goes through this time :D

&#x200B;

Anyhow, so here is how I went on reducing my utilities by almost 80% and this is with starting from a lower base already vs average american house.

&#x200B;

We live in about 2200 sq ft of house, ranch style. Built in 1958, so lots of leaky. When I first moved in with my now wife, the average usage of utilities was the following:

\- Electricity 760 kWh/month

\- Gas (water and heat) - 820 therms annually

&#x200B;

I think it's best to keep numbers in consumption than actuall dollars (although I provide those as well), since prices differ around the country and also with time. The average price in my area is about 12 cents per kWh in electricity and 1 dollar give or take per therm of NG.

&#x200B;

We live in the Northeast and Winters are cold - according to the average our winters are about 6100 Heating Degree Days and it gets hot and humid in summer.

&#x200B;

Here's what I did chronologically:

&#x200B;

\#1 - First move was to change all light bulbs to CFLs. This was in 2013 so LEDs were still very expensive at around 9-10$ per bulb. Since CFLs don't differ that much from power output from LEDs (maybe like 20%) it never made sense $$ wise to go for LEDs when CFLs were available at 1-2 dollars a pop. Before, the whole power output of light bulbs in the house was around 2000-3000 W... when all bulbs were changed the whole power output in the house sits around at 250-300W ... As an example, TODAY if we have the whole house with the lights on, it would use less energy than before when we had 3-5 lights on in the living room 6 hours a day or so. Cost on new lights = $70

&#x200B;

\#2 - I am frugal (hence being here...or at least as my mother tells me I am Spartan. I don't mind paying for things of good quality), therefore the dumb thermostats never echoed with me. In 2013 I bought a NEST. At the time I believe NEST was the only wifi t-stat and while I know I could probably get by with a programmable thermostat, the designs were not that appealing and I liked having the wifi access anyhow. Of course I didn't buy it new. Bought it off of ebay in 2013 for about $95. It's been now almost 6 years, and never had an issue with it. It paid itself in no time. With the Nest I started putting the heat off whenever out of the house or at night (with setbacks in the mid 50s). This itself brought big savings in orders of 30-40% in heat. Cost = $95

&#x200B;

\#3 Changing electrical suppliers - PA has a liberal market in the energy market, meaning you can choose who your supplier is from hundredds of suppliers. They website is pretty easy to navigate as well. Just input your zipcode and a lot of offers from different companies pop up. Just organize the list by Lowest Price to Highest and you're golden. You can usually get 20-35% lower prices than what the distribution company provides. These are all usually introductory offers for a limited amount of time (like 3, 6 or 12 months for example) so once that time expires just pop onto the website and go for the lowest offer again and jump to a different company. Been doing this for 4-5 years now and it takes maybe 10 minutes every 6 months. For those of you that use 1,000 or more kWh/month it's definitely worth it.

&#x200B;

\#4 While renovating and redesigning our living room to open space, we had to put a beam and with this access to attic. While up there and since we had the whole thing torn apart we decided to add insulation. Being the perfectionist that I am, I didn't want to just spray insulation on top of what we had there (4-5 inches of loose fiberglass and some spaces even lacking). Air leaks and cracks, even when insulated on top, leak a lot of air, so I wanted to seal off everything. So, we removed all Fiberglass in trash bags by using a leaf blower in reverse and using flexible air ducts to bring all loose fiberglass downstairs to a big mesh bag. This enabled me to air seal all cracks, top plates and fan cans and light boxes from the attic. We decided to put about 18"" of cellulose on our attic for a total of about R65-R70.

Our local Lowe's sold each bag at 12.95 dollars which is expensive IMO - we needed about 120 bags. A local store also had bags at about 8 dollars per bag if buying 100 of them, but Lowes had the FREE machine to spray the insulation which we needed. So I played the price match game with Lowes, where they priced matched it to 7,20 per bag and I also used they 50 off of 250 coupons in order to bring the price lower. Not only that, buying Lowes gift cards at 10-15% discount from 3rd party gift card markets brought it even lower, along with cashback portals. In the end we paid for each bag about $4,90/bag !! Also, our electrical supplier had and still has lots of rebates going for insulation improvements (it's always worth checking it out. I received an extra $130 from the electrical provider, but if my heat were to be electric as well, they would cover 80% of the cost up to 450 dollars, while in my case it was only 25% of the cost up to $130.

Total cost = $400

&#x200B;

\#5 Fridge - we had an old fridge that came with the house when we bought it. I knew it was old from the start but not as old as I ended up finding. Great machine! Cooled things like no other fridge did and probably will outlast any of the new ones, but I digress. The fridge was built in either 1983 or 1992 judging from the serial number and a little bit of Google. I would honestly say it is a 1983. However that thing used about 3 kWh/day. It never made much sense to just buy a new one just for the sake of it, but we had it in the plans to buy one that would go with our renovation. And we did exactly that recently. We bought a nice European fridge from a warehouse at a steep discount and sold the other one on Craigslist for $230 dollars. In the end, the NET cost of the new fridge was $450. Best thing though, the new fridge only uses about 0.2-0.4 kWh per day !!

&#x200B;

So here's how much we used to spend on utilities before all this:

\- Old spending $2200/year give or take

&#x200B;

With all the improvements we are now using only 190-200 kWh/month and this includes using dryer, landscape lights (LED of course) and cooking (we cook everyday) and having computer 24/7. Heat wise, this year we have only spent 200 therms of gas during an average winter of 6000 HDDs. Better yet, we don't have aggressive setbacks anymore. We keep the house always at 60F when sleeping or away, and around 68F when at home, so in essence we even increase indoor temps and the savings were that big!

Also, during the summer, while before the house used to get hot pretty quick, we can usually get by a full day without AC unless it's a heat wave of several days or the temps at night don't drop enough where opening windows and using fan would bring the temperatures lower.

&#x200B;

The new spending is therefore $750/year (already confirmed throguh the last 12 months). Consumption decrease almost 80% and spending almost 70%. There isn't much more we can save now. The only way, would be instead of having gas heat, change it to electricity through European multi-splits system, where we wouldn't need ducts and by being electricity we could drop the gas contract (which the customer charge is $17/month). The mini-split system would give both AC and Heat and since most of them have COP of 4 or higher it would end up being cheaper to use than NG (not by much though). But both our furnace and AC are pretty new - put in by prevous owner - installed around 2010 or so according to manufacture date of systems on their labels. Another way to save would be having a on-demand water heat but since ours is still pretty new it doesn't make sense to change as of now just to save some pennies. The same goes for windows (our windows while they are double pane they are crap) which would cost a lot just to save a couple dollars. Same for wall insulation - I'd love to insulate my walls - but when running the numbers and hassle of insulating the walls (which our house is lacking I am sure) it doesn't make sense. Our highest electric bill is about 40ish dollars in the summer and highest gas bill was 50 dollars back in Jan/February (coldest months)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

And by these improvements instead of 3 tons of AC size, next time we need a new AC system, we can go by with only 1ton or 1.5 tons max which is crazy. And for all environmentalists out there, we are saving the planet 10 Metric tons (22,000 lbs) of CO2 emissions on a yearly basis.

&#x200B;

So all this to say, that you dont need a lot of money to get big returns! For about $1000 (and this includes a new fridge) and a lot of DIY work and being smart on how you buy your materials, you can save a lot and increase the comfort of your home. It pays to check for rebates as well! And you don't need to have good wall insulation for the most part, most of the returns come from insulating the heck out of your attic! And you can totally use HDDs and current usage and estimate the savings before hand to see if it's worth it. I did mine and my estimates weren't that far off from what ended up being in reality.

For some perspective, I'm about to hit 30 and I was a smoker since I was 19. I totally forgot that I was keeping track of this about 6 months in. It wasn't until I was cleaning out apps that I saw this and figured I'd share this with you guys.

For some background, I live in Chicago where a pack of cigarettes are about $11-13 (or at least they were north side of the city). I remember making the leap of faith April 19, 2016 because I was working out my budget. I saw on Mint that I was spending over $300 a month on cigarettes and I figured it was enough and surprisingly I was able to stick with it purely because money was my motivating factor.

This was definitely a really hard habit to break, I remember buying a vape at the time which helped me when I was driving (where my cravings hit me the most). After about a month or 3, I just didn't have that super strong urge and now I just completely don't even feel the need for it. Hope this inspires others!

TLDR - Quit smoking a little over a year ago after buying a pack a day, saved over 5k."
FreeTaxUSA is the best!,1ih2aa0,2023-08-13 23:29:16,132,3528,"That‚Äôs it! So simple, less upselling, does the same job as other tax sites.

Husband spends 1/3 of our money on comic books,dbvqal,2023-08-13 23:29:16,804,3523,"I often share advice here, but today it's me coming to you for perspective.

Married less than a year, and we don't have money troubles. I feel like this is more about ... Fairness? Common goals? Letting go of the past/sunk cost? For reference, were both about 40 y.o.

I track spending pretty closely, though it's not like I reign in certain categories per se. More, I track it for knowledge. Husband says he's happy to let me do all the financial planning, since I'm so good at it. He's said he wants me to help us reach our discussed common goals and be secure. The last thing I want is to be a new wife who says he can't go to Cons or hang out at the board game store and play tournaments or whatever. But there's this comic thing he has. We're paying $100/month for a climate-controlled storage closet to store these. He spends about 1/3 of our disposable income per month on them. He brings home a few boxes from the comic store, and then the box(es) go unsorted into the storage locker. In the year we've been together, I've never once seen him read a comic book.

He says he has this vision that once we have a house with more room, he'll sort them and read entire series. I get it. I love reading. But he's spending more than our rent each month on this collection. And when he had a larger place all to himself, he didn't have them sorted then, either.

I love that he's a nerd. I wouldn't have it any other way. If he lives for 80 more years, I can't imagine he'll read half of them, if any. Money could go to debt, or retirement, or joint purchases/goals. Keep in mind, this money he spends on these is in addition to his disposable spending on other things/hobbies. On average, his hobby spending is half the monthly cost of the comics. I mean, I get it. He doesn't buy lots of clothes or shoes or makeup or cigarettes or drugs. But it's not like I can spend an equivalent amount on MY hobbies or interests, because we couldn't afford it.

How do you talk to someone who's self identity is almost tied up in these that it's ok to not finish collecting the entire series for each of these? How do you talk about how he's not betraying that 13-y.o. version of himself that found his only solace in comics? How can I explain how out of proportion the spending is to other things? 

If the bills are paid on time, and the CC balances aren't going up, he emotionally sees no reason to not spend like this. 

I'm here to listen. I'm here to get other perspectives. We've never fought about this, and I doubt we ever will. But I wanted to have another conversation with him, and I was hoping to come to it with some fresh insight and ways I can compromise.

Edit: some clarifications (1) I earn half the family income (2) I should have technically said ""discretionary"" spending, which is different than disposable (3) He spends on average 50% of the discretionary spending on his hobbies (2/3 of which is this comics collection), leaving 25% for ""us"" things like vacations and gifts, etc, and 25% my hobbies/personal spending.

Thank you everyone for all the insights and ideas. I appreciate it immensely.

The story of your best Frugal Flex?,lj79w9,2023-08-13 23:29:16,738,3512,"What's the time where your frugality/thriftiness absolutely blew someone away? About 8 years ago I was invited to my neighbors' wedding, I'm notorious for my pretty casual fashion sense so the groom jokingly told me I'd better show up looking good. I took that as a personal challenge so I started hitting the thrift stores regularly and eventually I found an Armani suit (blue pin stripe, three button, a bit outdated but still stylish) that was a little too big for me but was $25. I took it to my dry cleaner/tailor (who was pretty floored) and had it altered for about $25. The day of wedding rolls around and the groom walks up to me at the reception and tells me I look great, I just flash the label on the jacket and say ""Thanks, it's Armani."" Jaw, meet floor."

Reminder: Even fancy-ass coffee is cheaper than buying it take-out.,k9xd84,2023-08-13 23:29:16,340,3511,"This might seem a little obvious for most of you, but I recently did the math over this past year of lockdown.

I often see comparisons people make for big tubs of Kirkland brand or Folgers coffee made in 12 cup automatic coffee makers, getting under 10¬¢ a cup. My parents only drink the cheap stuff and tell me that I am a snob and that I'm silly for paying so much for coffee, so I did the math.

I subscribe to a very popular coffee by mail service. On average a 12 oz bag of coffee cost $20. Roasted to order, delivered in a few days, top quality, supporting small businesses across the country, I absolutely love it. I end up using (by myself) one 12 oz bag every two weeks, this has been very consistent working from home everyday over the pandemic. I make two cups a day using roughly 15g of coffee per 240mL water with a single pour over, occasionally three coffees on a weekend. That works out to roughly 30 coffees made per bag.

So in the end, I'm paying only $0.66 for fan-fucking-tastic, very strong, serious gourmet shit. Worth every penny"

"Some thoughts on weddings, from someone who's been to over 40 of them.",jrw60a,2023-08-13 23:29:16,304,3500,"So for a bit of background, I'm a wedding photographer. Including weddings I've attended I've been to 40, maybe nearer 50 weddings. I've seen the best and the worst.

One of the things I've noticed is that there is really no correlation between cost spent and the ""quality"" or enjoyment of the wedding. The best wedding I ever shot was a 400+ person, fairly boujee wedding. The couple was amazing, though, incredibly genuine, and had great family. I teared up during their dance.

The second best wedding I shot was about 60 people. The bride had a hookup on a nice small venue that she and her sister decorated themselves with homemade centerpieces made from lavender and other less expensive plants, they rented speakers and hooked up a laptop with a spotify playlist their friends curated together, they got food catered and aunties made desserts. This wedding was a r/frugal pipe dream guys.

But it was awesome, because the bride and groom were so into it and genuine, they have great friends, they partied, and families were sweet. 

So after being to so many weddings and seeing cookie cutter stuff, unique, cheap, expensive, my thoughts really are that regardless of what you spend, how big it is, what the venue looks like, the best weddings are between two people who care about each other and just want to celebrate one another and their family. That's it. Everything else is extra. 

I realize I'm preaching to the choir on this sub, but who knows who needs to hear it.

More specifically, here are some things I think are and aren't worth it, assuming you've set a budget and are having a wedding-wedding.

Worth it:

* A decent photographer, if you want one at all. I realize phones are so good now and some people are cool with just asking family to take photos, but if you do want a photographer get someone solid. It doesn't have to be a $10,000 luxury photog who sends you a leather bound book, but if you're going to pay your 15 year old artist niece or nephew $200 to do it, just stick with the phones.

* Tailoring for a suit. You don't have to spend a lot nowadays to get a suit that fits. Assuming you're going traditional, spend enough to get a plain black suit that's tailored to you and fits well. Fit is so much more important than the materials themselves. Keeping it simple means you can wear that suit for any other occasion that requires it. Also, if you're buying more affordable shoes, consider an in-sole because you'll be standing all day.

* Gifts for your groomsmen/bridesmaids. They don't have to be anything fancy at all, but I do think it's really sweet and a nice start to the day. This is totally my personal opinion though.

* Good food. Again, you don't have to spend a ton (I've had people get food trucks for weddings, costs $20-40 a head and some of them are *bomb*). But low quality food can be a big damper on the day. 

* Desserts in some form (homemade is great if you have the ability) and some fun late night food. Some pizzas or something late at a wedding while people are drunk dancing is always a hit.

* EDIT: A lot of comments about day-of planners with positive reviews. Apparently worth it!

Now, a few things that are less worth it if you're trying to stick to a budget, imo:

* A videographer. I promise I'm not biased here - high quality video work that you'll actually want to watch again can be so expensive, and how often will you really watch it vs wedding photos you can put up on a wall? If you really want some recordings, this is a good time to ask Uncle Darren to put his DSLR up on a tripod at the back of the venue during your ceremony. Your friends will probably take videos of the night festivities.

* Fancy dresses, shoes, suits. Everyone is different on this but the fit of your clothes, your smile, your compatibility matter so much more. No one will see your fancy shoes with a huge dress anyway. 

* Open bar. A lot of people are doing toonie bars (I'm Canadian :) ) which I think is super cool. Charging $7 for a beer is super lame as if you're trying to make money, but $2 for a beer is just covering your cost so your wild cousin Tina doesn't dry up your bank account.

* Crazy decorations. It's such a short period of time, and people will be drunk before too long. Keep it classy and simple. 

* A wedding planner shouldn't be necessary if you're keeping it small and are relatively organized. 

* Crazy cakes. You're gonna chop it up. Towers of cupcakes or donuts are very common nowadays and are awesome. Get cheap toppers from a party store and you're in business.

* A DJ. They can get so pricey nowadays. Bands, imo, are worth it if they're in your budget because it's such a fun experience, but DJs less-so in my opinion. Find a trustworthy family member or two to emcee and load up a Spotify playlist with your friend. Speakers and DJ lights can be rented locally in most cities. 


That's all I've got. This ran way longer than I anticipated but I hope someone can get some use out of it. Feel free to ask about any elements of the day you're wondering about, or what else may or may not be worth it. Also curious to hear others' opinions!"

or you could pay your credit card

"Wife and I vacationed 8 days in Ireland for $2,500 (air fare included). And we could have spent less!",8ts8eu,2023-08-13 23:29:16,297,3433,"I took a shot at planning our first overseas vacation rather than booking through a company. If you're looking to save money, and still do a lot of stuff this is the way to go. First, I'll give you a break down of the costs then discuss each thing.

To be clear, we did not skimp on experiences. We went to five different cities on the Eastern, Southern, and Western coast of Ireland. We went to 6 different castles, we went to the Cliffs of Moher, traveled to the Wicklow Mountains, St Kevin's cathedral and the Glendalough. It was quite an adventure for the money. 

Air fare - $1200
Nightly accommodations (8 nights) - $580
Car rental (4 days) - $160
Food/Snacks/Beer - $300
Public transportation - $120
Shopping/tours/sight seeing - $200

Air fare: $600 per ticket seems low, but we found several flights to Dublin for under $400. In fact, I recently booked tickets to Dublin for a guys trip in September for $325 out of Boston. Patience and Google Flights are key. If you're interested to know more let me know but there are a lot better resources on flying cheap than me. 

Nightly accommodations: This could have been a lot lower, but we booked four different bed & breakfasts around Ireland.  We booked 2 nights at a hotel and stayed one night in a hostel. The key for us was booking places that served breakfast. Yes, I ate traditional Irish breakfast every single day. 

Car rental: We took public transportation for 4 days and rented a car for 4 days. Booking in advance is your friend. If you book 2+ months out, we were seeing $30 a day everywhere. 

Food/snacks/beer: $300 seems low, but remember we ate breakfast at the hotel. For lunch, we usually popped into a grocery store and picked up chips/sandwhich/drink combo for $4. We had a nice dinner out 4 out of the 7 nights we were there and just got pizza or fast food other 3 nights. After we rented a car we picked up $30 in snacks which held us over for in between meals rest of the trip. My wife doesn't drink and all, and beer was so expensive I took it kind of easy on the sauce. 

Public transportation: Ireland's public transport is fire. For $20 each you can get a 72 hour unlimited pass for Dublin which let's you take trains and busses. We took the train to a suburb on the Eastern coast called Howth. It was a beautiful little harbor town. We took public busses from Kilkenny to Waterford, Waterford to Cork and Galway to Dublin. Total cost for all that mentioned was only $120. Students in Ireland get free public transportation. 

Shopping tours sightseeing: Ireland allows you to buy something called a Heritage card, which is good for a year. Allows you to see 80+ attractions in Ireland. They're about $50 each. Entry to most of the sites are north of $15 so well worth it. Also most museums are free in Ireland. As mentioned wife and I did several castles and tours with the heritage card. And they're not stupid places either, these sites are some of the best Ireland had to offer. 

I decided to post this because we've been married 16 years and always assumed overseas travel was cost prohibitive. And I'd like to let others know it's not! If you have any questions hit me up!"

"A method I use to 'scratch' the itch for a ""new thing""",9p2vbr,2023-08-13 23:29:16,248,3394,"So, sometimes I feel like I ""need"" something new -- sometimes I'm attracted to improved features, or feel like I'm missing out or whatever. It happens to most of us. This is what I do instead:

I deep clean the thing I already own, make repairs, even paint or customize it if that would make it better.

For example, I've had the itch to get a new vehicle. But, instead, I really detailed the car with good-quality products. The dog had made a mess of the backseat cushions. I took them entirely out and scrubbed them down, let them dry in the sun to get rid of dog odor. I buffed out some scratches, got the windows almost invisible, oil hinges, even cleaned out the trunk area. There was almost no dog hair, dust, or dirt anywhere. Sure there were some 'character marks' but once the car was deep cleaned and shiny (and smelling good, because I put in a brand new air freshener) it really scratched that itch for 'new shiny.'

I've done this with appliance and kitchen stuff, shoes... you name it, I've done it. I was feeling some sewing machine envy the other day, but I broke out the toolbox instead and got my machine up to snuff and moving smoothly. Boom, desire gone.

ETA: sometimes I'm really attracted to a feature on a product -- like an ice maker or some other 'convenience.' When it's feature envy, I always try to figure out a way to rig-up that feature. In my case -- I only want ice for a few months out of the year. Buying a bag of ice once a year for a whole 2 dollars, even for the rest of my life will be far, far cheaper than a new fridge and the water line to make the icemaker go."

There was a big box of imitation crab meat that I found at Kroger for $10, plenty to make at least four big rolls. I tossed them in a skillet with butter garlic and Old Bay, and put them on a brioche roll.

I've done miniature rolls with this meat as well, with a mayo-based sauce or garlic butter, these have been an absolute favorite party appetizer. Also a benefit for people that may be allergic to shellfish as these are made from pollock.

I thought this might be a good frugal post because it is a pretty valid substitute for lobster at about 1/10 of the cost! Highly recommend =)"

Opinion: being Frugal does not mean buying the cheapest one available.,hr78cy,2023-08-13 23:29:16,295,3352,"Recently purchased a new sectional sofa .  After extensive research and shopping around,  I realized that most furniture stores sell cheaply made products that have terrible build quality.  Sure you can buy a new sectional for $899, but it's stapled together cheap wood covered with thin fabric.  I feel like there still is a lot of truth in ""you get what you pay for."""
"What are the best ""Buy once use for a lifetime"" purchases?",16fexa4,2023-08-13 23:29:16,2667,3359,"I'm young and looking for good purchases that will save me money in the long run. Things that people don't always thing about. I consider myself pretty frugal already, but there's always more to learn.

As an example of what I'm looking for, I saw a post that was using cloth show towels instead of paper, since they'd pay for themselves long term and were less wasteful.
I think a good mattress might also qualify, though you probably will have to eventually replace it."
"Better meal planning is saving my family $400/month, yay.",7300ey,2023-08-13 23:29:16,192,3353,"I was kind of shocked/thrilled this morning when I reviewed my family's recent bank statements and saw that our revamping of our meal planning (well, creation of a meal plan instead of nothing) is saving us $400 a month. We did some pretty basic things, the main one being creating a spreadsheet of recipes that are 1) inexpensive, 2) have a *cheap* high-calorie ingredient (I'm skinny and need ~2,200/day to maintain weight, so I'd tend to overspend on hearty food), and 3) are large enough for leftovers.

I point this out because of one big budgeting surprise we had. We thought we were overspending because of eating out a lot. Instead, it was because bad meal planning meant we were wasting a ton of the food that we bought at the grocery store or not paying attention to cheaper alternatives for meals or individual ingredients. Better grocery store buying habits accounted for $300 of the $400 saved.

The other unexpectedly simple step was to print out the recipes we liked instead of just, say, bookmarking them online. It's made it so easy to just take out our recipe folder and one person pulls out, like, eight recipes that sound good, then the other person narrows it down to four, and you're done."

Sometimes you pay more for the experience.,xpe11f,2023-08-13 23:29:16,253,3303,"This topic came up between my FIL and I when we went apple picking last weekend. My son is a baby and I thought it would be a fun experience for the family to walk through a beautiful apple orchard on an early fall day. We had a great time up until we had to pay for the apples. They were 1.50 a pound. I didn't even pay 20 bucks for the whole bag. Man my FIL pitched a fit. ""These con artists are ripping you off. I get 1/2 pecks of apples for 99 cents."" ""Your crazy for paying these prices!""

I told him that I am more than happy to pay more for the memories I created with my family. It's not really paying for the apples. It was 20 bucks to spend an amazing morning with my closest family and create memories. We got to hike around a beautiful place and laugh at the baby. People pay thousands for trips like that. I'm very frugal but I guess my point is that the value of a thing is not just in its material. I pay for a membership to a organic farm every year. The cost is more than produce at the store but I get to take my son to pick vegetables on this epic farm. That's priceless!"

Edit to add back story.. and to say thanks for the comments
In the 10 years after leaving college I had had only crap jobs, mostly in construction or manufacturing.  The job I left for the bank was working in a factory doing Quality Assurance work for $11/hour, it involved a lot of statistics, data entry and some computer work, I really worked at learning the statistics software and ended up learning some basic (ha! no pun intended) programing at the same time. That got me an interview and eventually an entry level data analysts job at the bank. I took every single course they offered in house as well as a couple of night courses in programing. By end of year one I had moved well beyond entry level eventually to the point that I was writing code for investment analytics and trading..

Anyway .. at the time I had clothes suitable for factory work but nothing of the business casual needed to work in an office fortunately I had a couple friends in sales jobs .. they had the appropriate clothing."

"Why I think a Rice Cooker is a good, Frugal investment.",7wwsti,2023-08-13 23:29:16,615,3213,"Hi all!

I'm a broke student and most of my meals consist of rice and beans, or rice and chicken if it was on sale when I went shopping. Either way, I eat a lot of rice. So I'm here to talk to you about something near and dear to my heart; my $17 rice cooker. 

This baby is an amazing, powerful, little machine that takes up next to no space but provides endless options for food. You have a small, circular object that can fit into awkward nooks and crannies. When you pull it out, you can cook all types of rice in it, efficiently and evenly. The best part is, you can't burn anything! (I mean, unless you leave it on for like 10 days it may explode or just plain die I wouldn't recommend leaving it on for more than like 2 hours) 

You plug it in, it automatically warms itself and whatever else in it. But pro tip - don't plug it in unless there *is* something in it. The coil won't distribute heat evenly and that's not a good thing (also another way to ruin it!). But stay away from those two things and you're good!

But seriously. If you are competent in the kitchen, you can use a rice cooker. You use the measuring cup it comes with, even out 2:1, or whatever ratios are on the back, of the rice/quinoa/other dry things you want to cook. Add the doubled water and then put it in the pot together. Plug it in and bam, you start warming it. Flick 1 switch down, and you're cooking! Man, that was difficult. So now what? You let it cook. It knows when it's done, and will flick itself back into the warming stage. Isn't that cool? If you're like me and have 1 hour classes to go to, I start it just before I leave for class and then I have warm rice waiting for me when I get home! 

Do you have to just cook rice in it? Nope! You can use it to steam veggies and stuff too, or add chicken into the mix, (At least so mine claims. But I haven't yet verified that it actually cooks chicken well)

Anyways, I have been eating way more rice, way cheaper than normal, and have absolutely saved not spending money on dinner in the last 2 weeks since I got it. Easy to clean too, non-stick so the rice slides right out. :)

TLDR; This is my glowing recommendation for a frugal buy: RICE COOKER. 

Edit - if you‚Äôre just gonna comment about how easy rice is to cook already and how a rice cooker isnt frugal, please don‚Äôt. I understand it‚Äôs easy to be confused at someone who needs something you don‚Äôt, but think about the why I need this as opposed to if it‚Äôs needed in general - I wouldn‚Äôt cook if I made enough money to go out every night. A $17 rice cooker IS frugal for me. If it‚Äôs not for you, don‚Äôt buy one. But it‚Äôs changed my life and finances. "
